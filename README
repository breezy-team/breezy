bzr-git, a plugin for bzr that adds git support.

This was originally written as a proof of concept at Europython 2006 by
Robert Collins, using stgit's convenience methods for accessing gits head
and parsing git output. Later, it was adapted to use James Westby's Python
Git module (which had by then be renamed to "Dulwich") and extended to support
push and pull by Jelmer Vernooij.

Please see INSTALL for installation instructions, and TODO for future plans.
