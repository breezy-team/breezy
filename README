README for Bazaar
=================

Bazaar (``bzr``) is a decentralized revision control system, designed to be
easy for developers and end users alike.  Bazaar is part of the GNU project
to develop a complete free operating system.

To install Bazaar, follow the instructions given at
http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download. Ready-to-install packages are available
for most popular operating systems or you can install from source.

To learn how to use Bazaar, see the official documentation at:

    http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/en/

For additional training materials including screencasts and slides,

Bazaar is written in Python, and is sponsored by Canonical Limited, the
founders of Ubuntu and Launchpad. Bazaar is Free Software, and is released
under the GNU General Public License.

Bazaar highlights
=================

Bazaar directly supports both central version control (like cvs/svn) and
distributed version control (like git/hg). Developers can organize their
workspace in whichever way they want on a per project basis including:

* checkouts (like svn)
* feature branches (like hg)
* shared working tree (like git).

It also directly supports and encourages a large number of development best
practices like refactoring and pre-commit regression testing. Users can
choose between our command line tool and our cross-platform GUI application.
