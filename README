bzr-builddeb
============

Overview
--------

This is bzr-builddeb, a plugin for `bzr`_ that allows you to build `Debian`_
packages from a bzr branch. 

.. _bzr: http://bazaar-vcs.org/
.. _Debian: http://www.debian.org/

I apologies for the lack of information in this README, I promise I will
provide proper documentation soon.

Installation
------------

This plugin requires `python-debian`_ (at least version 0.1.1),
`python-deb822`_, and a version of bzr at least 0.14. The two python modules 
are available in Debian (though maybe not at the required versions for a
development version of builddeb), the former in experimental at the moment.

.. _python-debian: http://bzr.debian.org/pkg-python-debian/trunk/
.. _python-deb822: http://free.linux.hp.com/~jswright/deb822/

This plugin can be installed in two ways. As you are probably using a Debian
system you can probably just use the debian packages. The other way is to 
branch it in to ``~/.bazaar/plugins/bzr-builddeb``, i.e::

  bzr branch http://jameswestby.net/bzr/bzr-builddeb/ \
    ~/.bazaar/plugins/bzr-buildeb

This will give you a ``bzr builddeb`` command (alias ``bd``).

Help for this plugin can be found by running ``bzr help builddeb``.

There is also a script named ``bzr-buildpackage`` provided in /usr/bin
that provides access to the tool as well. It is just a wrapper script that
calls ``bzr builddeb`` with the arguments you provide, so the rest of the
documentation applies equally well to using this script. Probably the only
difference is that help will be got with ``bzr-buildpackage ---help`` 
(as ``bzr builddeb --help`` also works and does the same as
``bzr help builddeb``). The script is provided for two reasons, the first
is similarity to the other ``-buildpackage`` systems, and the second is so
that the Debian package can provide the ``bzr-buildpackage`` package, and
so make it easier for people to find the package.

Configuration
-------------

There are also configuration files that can be used, these are, in the order
that values will be used if found::

  * .bzr-builddeb/local.conf (in the package directory)
  * ~/.bazaar/builddeb.conf
  * .bzr-builddeb/default.conf (in the package directory)

All configuration can be overriden on the command line.

These files must start with::

  [BUILDDEB]

Configuration Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then can have the configuration options:

  * ``build-dir = path``

    The directory in which the build takes place. (Defaults to 
    ``../build-area`` relative to the branch).

  * ``result-dir = path``

    The directory the resulting files will be placed in. (Defaults to whatever
    is being used for ``build_dir``).

  * ``merge = True``

    Turns on merge mode. This is where only the ``debian/`` directory is 
    versioned. It uses and ``orig.tar.gz`` for the upstream and combines the
    two before building. It works with both the ``debian/`` directory in the 
    branch, or the contents of ``debian/`` (e.g. ``rules``, ``control``) 
    directly in the top level directory of the branch. (Defaults to ``False``).

  * ``native = True``

    If you want to build a native package from a branch then turn on this
    option. It will stop the plugin from looking for an ``orig.tar.gz`` and
    build a native package instead. This has no effect if merge mode is on,
    as I don't think it makes any sense to version the ``debian/`` separately
    for a native package. If you disagree let me know.

  * ``split = True``

    This takes a package from a branch that includes both the upstream source
    and the ``debian/`` dir and creates a non-native package from it by
    creating an ``orig.tar.gz`` from the code outside of ``debian/``. This
    is probably most useful if you are bot upstream and Debian maintainer
    of a non-native package. This has no effect if ``merge`` or ``native``
    are true, the former is for use when you don't version the full source,
    the second for when you don't need an ``orig.tar.gz`` so they make no sense
    to be used together.

  * ``export-upstream = path``

    This option takes a path (remote or local) to a bzr branch that contains
    the upstream code. If this is set then the plugin will export the code
    from that branch to create the ``.orig.tar.gz``. This option only has any
    effect if ``merge`` is set, and causes any ``orig-dir`` setting to be
    ignored.

  * ``export-upstream-revision = revision``

    This sets the revision that the upstream code will be branched at. It takes
    the same revision spec as the normal --revision parameter. Use it to
    associate an upstream version number with a particular revision of the
    upstream code. This has no effect if ``export-upstream`` is not set.

  * ``orig-dir = path``

    The directory to search for the ``.orig.tar.gz`` when not in native mode. 
    (Defaults to ``../tarballs`` relative to the branch).

  * ``builder = command``

    The command to use to build the package. Defaults to ``dpkg-buildpackage 
    -rfakeroot -uc -us``).

  * ``quick-builder = command``

    The command used to build the package if the ``--quick`` option is used. 
    (Defaults to ``fakeroot debian/rules binary``).

  * ``ignore-unknowns = True``

    Don't count unknown files in the tree as changes, and so allow the build
    to proceed with them. Note that the unknown files will not be used in the
    build and so you must ``bzr add`` them if you want to use them. If they
    are not wanted in the build then a better solution is probably to add
    an ignore for them or delete them. (Defaults to False, as I am forgetful,
    and it helps to remind me to add files after I create them.)

The idea is that certain options can be set in ``.bzr-builddeb/default.conf`` 
that apply to the package on all systems, or that there is a default that is 
wanted that differs from the default provided. ``merge = True`` is a perfect 
example of this.

Then the user can override this locally if they want for all of their packages
(they prefer ``builder = pdebuild``), so they can set this in 
``~/.bazaar/builddeb.conf``. They can override it for the package if they want 
(e.g. they have a different location for upstream tarballs of a package if
they are involved with upstream as well, so they set ``orig_dir = 
/home/.../releases/``), this can be done in ``.bzr-builddeb/local.conf``). If
the ``local.conf`` file is used it will be added to ``.bzrignore`` so that the
changes don't affect other developers.


Creating a package
------------------

Below are instructions for creating a package. These instructions differ 
depending on whether you want to use merge mode or not.

First the common start create a directory to hold your work. This is not
absolutely necessary, but as you still get all the power of bzr when using 
this plugin, so you might want to branch etc. and so this will be useful 
later on::

  $ mkdir path/to/project

If you are going to be using branches then the following is a good optimisation
you can use::

  $ bzr init-repo --trees path/to/project

Now create your global config file if you want to change something like the
builder in use, or have aglobal result directory or similar::

  $ echo "[BUILDDEB]" > ~/.bazaar/builddeb.conf
  $ $EDITOR ~/.bazaar/builddeb.conf

and any options that you want.

I will describe creating a new project, but for existing projects you can
copy the code over and call ``bzr init`` then continue in the same way.

I will also describe the setup that conforms to the default options for
directories. If you wish to use a different layout set up the options to 
your liking and tweak the commands below as necessary.

Using merge mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use merge mode you need to create a tarballs directory for
the ``.orig.tar.gz`` files:: 

  $ cd path/to/project
  $ mkdir tarballs

Then copy the ``.orig.tar.gz`` file for the current version in to this 
directory.

If upstream holds their code in a bzr branch then you don't need to create the
tarballs yourself, you can instead have the plugin export the upstream code and
create the tarball itself using the ``export-upstream`` option. You need to be
careful with this, as if you do not change the upstream version in the
``debian/changelog`` and upstream makes some commits then the ``.orig.tar.gz``
will change without being reflected in the version number. This can be
disastorous if it happens across uploads of the package. Use
``export-upstream-revision`` to avoid this.  You might be especially interested
in the ``use-existing`` flag to the plugin to save having to branch the
upstream code every build. You might also want to make a local mirror.

Now create the branch for the ``debian/`` directory::

  $ bzr init project

Now you can either create a ``project/debian/`` directory for all the files, 
or add them in the ``project`` directory.
    
Now tell bzr-builddeb that this is a merge mode project:: 

  $ cd project/
  $ mkdir .bzr-builddeb/
  $ echo -e "[BUILDDEB]\nmerge = True" > .bzr-builddeb/default.conf

Now you are ready to create the project. Create the usual files, and edit them 
to your satisfaction. When you have the files run::

  $ bzr add
  $ bzr ci

from the root of the project branch.

You are now ready to build the project. See below for instructions on doing
this.

Non-merge mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a little simpler to set up. Create the branch for the project::

  $ cd path/to/project
  $ bzr init project

Now add all the project files to the branch, and add the to bzr::

  $ cd project
  $ bzr add
  $ bzr ci

There are two options when you want to build a Debian package, whether
it is a native package or not. Most packages are non-native so I will desribe
that first.

To create a non-native package you need an upstream tarball to build against.
Set the ``orig-dir`` variable to the directory containing the tarball that
you want to use and the plugin will pick it up and you will have a non-native
package.

However sometimes you might be upstream of a package as well as Debian
maintainer, but it is not a native package. In that case you may version
the whole source including ``debian/``, but not want to have to manually
make a tarball without the ``debian/`` directory. In that case see the
``split`` variable. If you set that then the plugin will create you an
appropriately named orig.tar.gz of everything outside of ``debian/``.

If you want to have a native package you don't need to worry about
``orig-dir``, but instead set ``native = True`` in the ``default.conf``
file (make sure it starts with ``[BUILDDEB]`` if you create it).

Now you are ready to build using the plugin.


Building a Package
------------------

Once your package is set up then building it is easy. Run the following 
command from the top-level of the project branch, after checking in all 
changes::

  $ bzr bd

If you used the default options this should build the package and leave the
resulting files in ``../build-area``. 

Tips
----

If you are trying to solve a problem, and you are trying lots of different
fixes you might not want to commit every time. If this is the case you can
tell bzr-builddeb to build from the working tree, rather than the branch. This
means that just editing files will be enough to change a build, rather than
the default, which requires a check-in of all changes before building. To do 
this use the ``--working-tree`` option, or more succinctly::

  $ bzr bd -w

If you also have a slow builder defined in your configuration (for instance 
``pdebuild``, you can bypass this by using the ``--quick`` option. This uses
whatever the ``quick_builder`` option is (defaults to ``fakeroot debian/rules
binary``).

If you are running in merge mode, and you have a large upstream tarball, and
you do not want to unpack it at every build you can speed things up even more.
This involves reusing the tarball each build, so saving the need to unpack it.
To do this run::

  $ bzr --export-only 

once to create a build-dir to use. (``-e`` is the short option for this). Then 
on the next builds you can use the ``--reuse`` and ``--dont-purge`` options to
keep using this build directory. **N.B. This may cause build problems, 
especially if files are removed**, it is advisable to run a build without 
``--purge`` after removing any files.


Workflow
--------

bzr-builddeb is designed to fit in with the workflow that bzr encourages. It
is designed as a plugin, so that it just becomes one more ``bzr`` command that
you run while working on the package.

It also works fine with the frequent branching approach of bzr, so that you 
can branch to test something new for the package, or for a bug fix, and then
merge it back in to your main branch when it is done.
