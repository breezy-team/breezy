This directory contains a simple plugin that adds 
Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/) branch support to 
Bazaar (http://www.bazaar-vcs.org/)

You will need a recent version of Bazaar-NG, at least 0.8 (or 
one of the 0.8 pre releases).

You also need the Subversion bindings for python, with my patch for svn_info_t (available at 
http://jelmer.vernstok.nl/files/patches/svn-client-info-python.diff)

Simply place this directory in ~/.bazaar/plugins and you should be able 
to check out branches from Subversion using bzr.
