= darcs-fast-import(1)

== NAME

darcs-fast-import - darcs backend to the 'fast-import stream' format

== SYNOPSIS

darcs-fast-import [<options>]

== DESCRIPTION

darcs-fast-import can produce a darcs repository from a fast-import
stream, read from the standard input. It supports incremental conversion
as well, via the --import-marks / --export-marks switches.

== OPTIONS

-h, --help::
	Display usage.

--import-marks::
	Import marks from a given file. This is read at the beginning of the
	conversion at once. Use it if you want to continue an incremental
	conversion.

--export-marks::
	Export marks to a given file at the end of the conversion. It can be the
	same as the one for --import-marks as it is written only once at the
	end. Use it if you want to be able to incrementally update the target
	repository later.

--logfile::
	The output of external commands are redirected to a log file. You can
	specify the path of that file with this parameter.

== EXIT CODES

The exit code is:

* 0 on success
* 1 on unhandled exception
* 2 in case the stream would try to let the importer create a symlink
