== NAME

x2d - convert git, bzr or hg repos to a darcs one using fast-export

== SYNOPSIS

x2d -f <format> [<importoptions>] <otherrepo>

== DESCRIPTION

x2d is a wrapper script that just automates doing an initial or
continuing an incremental conversion. All it does is initializing the
target darcs repo, starting darcs-fast-import and the relevant exporter
with the proper switches and pipe the importer's output to the
importer's standard input.

== OPTIONS

--help::
	Display usage.

-f <format>::
	Specify the format of the source repo. Currently supported sources are
	git, bzr and hg. Incremental conversion is supported for all of them.

The rest of the options is directly passed to darcs-fast-import.
