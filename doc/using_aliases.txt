Command aliases are an eay way to customize the behaviour of Bazaar-NG. Aliases
are an easy way to create shortcuts for commonly-typed commands, or to set
defaults for commands.

Command aliases can be defined in the **[ALIASES]** section of your
**.bazaar/bazaar.conf** file. Aliases start with the alias name, then an
equal sign, then a command fragment.  Here's an example ALIASES section:

Examples
========
A typical example::

    [ALIASES]
    recentlog=log -r-3..-1
    ll=log --line -r-10..-1
    commit=commit --strict
    diff=diff --diff-options -p

Explanation of examples
=======================

 * The first alias makes a new 'recentlog' command that shows the logs for the
   last three revisions
 * The **ll** alias shows the last 10 log entries in line format.
 * the **commit** alias sets the default for commit to refuse to commit if new
   files in the tree are not recognized.
 * the **diff** alias adds the coveted -p option to diff


Rules for Aliases
=================

 * You can override parts of the options given in an alias by overriding it.
   For example, if you run **lastlog -r-5..**, you will only get five
   line-based log entries instead of 10.
 * Aliases can override the standard behaviour of existing commands by giving
   an alias name that is thesame as the orignal command. For example, default
   commit is changed with **commit=commit --strict**.
 * Aliases can not refer to other aliases. In other words making a
   **lastlog** alias and referring to it with a **ll** alias will not work.

This includes aliases that override standard commands

 * Giving the **--no-aliases** to the bzr command will tell it to ignore aliases
   for that run. For example, running **bzr --no-aliases commit** will perform a
   standard commit instead not do a **commit --strict**.
