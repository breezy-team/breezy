bzr 0.7
#######

:Released: 2006-01-09

Changes
*******

* .bzrignore is excluded from exports, on the grounds that it's a bzr
  internal-use file and may not be wanted.  (Jamie Wilkinson)

* The "bzr directories" command were removed in favor of the new
  --kind option to the "bzr inventory" command.  To list all
  versioned directories, now use "bzr inventory --kind directory".
  (Johan Rydberg)

* Under Windows configuration directory is now ``%APPDATA%\bazaar\2.0``
  by default. (John Arbash Meinel)

* The parent of Bzr configuration directory can be set by ``BZR_HOME``
  environment variable. Now the path for it is searched in ``BZR_HOME``,
  then in HOME. Under Windows the order is: ``BZR_HOME``, ``APPDATA``
  (usually points to ``C:\Documents and Settings\User Name\Application Data``),
  ``HOME``. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Plugins with the same name in different directories in the bzr plugin
  path are no longer loaded: only the first successfully loaded one is
  used. (Robert Collins)

* Use system's external SSH command to open connections if possible.
  This gives better integration with user settings such as ProxyCommand.
  (James Henstridge)

* Permissions on files underneath .bzr/ are inherited from the .bzr
  directory. So for a shared repository, simply doing 'chmod -R g+w .bzr/'
  will mean that future file will be created with group write permissions.

* configure.in and config.guess are no longer in the builtin default
  ignore list.

* '.sw[nop]' pattern ignored, to ignore vim swap files for nameless
  files.  (John Arbash Meinel, Martin Pool)

Improvements
************

* "bzr INIT dir" now initializes the specified directory, and creates
  it if it does not exist.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* New remerge command (Aaron Bentley)

* Better zsh completion script.  (Steve Borho)

* 'bzr diff' now returns 1 when there are changes in the working
  tree. (Robert Collins)

* 'bzr push' now exists and can push changes to a remote location.
  This uses the transport infrastructure, and can store the remote
  location in the ~/.bazaar/branches.conf configuration file.
  (Robert Collins)

* Test directories are only kept if the test fails and the user requests
  that they be kept.

* Tweaks to short log printing

* Added branch nicks, new nick command, printing them in log output.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* If ``$BZR_PDB`` is set, pop into the debugger when an uncaught exception
  occurs.  (Martin Pool)

* Accept 'bzr resolved' (an alias for 'bzr resolve'), as this is
  the same as Subversion.  (Martin Pool)

* New FTP transport support (on ftplib), for ftp:// and aftp://
  URLs.  (Daniel Silverstone)

* Commit editor temporary files now start with ``bzr_log.``, to allow
  text editors to match the file name and set up appropriate modes or
  settings.  (Magnus Therning)

* Improved performance when integrating changes from a remote weave.
  (Goffredo Baroncelli)

* Sftp will attempt to cache the connection, so it is more likely that
  a connection will be reused, rather than requiring multiple password
  requests.

* bzr revno now takes an optional argument indicating the branch whose
  revno should be printed.  (Michael Ellerman)

* bzr cat defaults to printing the last version of the file.
  (Matthieu Moy, #3632)

* New global option 'bzr --lsprof COMMAND' runs bzr under the lsprof
  profiler.  (Denys Duchier)

* Faster commits by reading only the headers of affected weave files.
  (Denys Duchier)

* 'bzr add' now takes a --dry-run parameter which shows you what would be
  added, but doesn't actually add anything. (Michael Ellerman)

* 'bzr add' now lists how many files were ignored per glob.  add --verbose
  lists the specific files.  (Aaron Bentley)

* 'bzr missing' now supports displaying changes in diverged trees and can
  be limited to show what either end of the comparison is missing.
  (Aaron Bently, with a little prompting from Daniel Silverstone)

Bug Fixes
*********

* SFTP can walk up to the root path without index errors. (Robert Collins)

* Fix bugs in running bzr with 'python -O'.  (Martin Pool)

* Error when run with -OO

* Fix bug in reporting HTTP errors that don't have an HTTP error code.
  (Martin Pool)

* Handle more cases of pipe errors in display commands

* Change status to 3 for all errors

* Files that are added and unlinked before committing are completely
  ignored by diff and status

* Stores with some compressed texts and some uncompressed texts are now
  able to be used. (John A Meinel)

* Fix for bzr pull failing sometimes under windows

* Fix for SFTP transport under windows when using interactive auth

* Show files which are both renamed and modified as such in 'bzr
  status' output.  (Daniel Silverstone, #4503)

* Make annotate cope better with revisions committed without a valid
  email address.  (Marien Zwart)

* Fix representation of tab characters in commit messages.
  (Harald Meland)

* List of plugin directories in ``BZR_PLUGIN_PATH`` environment variable is
  now parsed properly under Windows. (Alexander Belchenko)

* Show number of revisions pushed/pulled/merged. (Robey Pointer)

* Keep a cached copy of the basis inventory to speed up operations
  that need to refer to it.  (Johan Rydberg, Martin Pool)

* Fix bugs in bzr status display of non-ascii characters.
  (Martin Pool)

* Remove Makefile.in from default ignore list.
  (Tollef Fog Heen, Martin Pool, #6413)

* Fix failure in 'bzr added'.  (Nathan McCallum, Martin Pool)

Testing
*******

* Fix selftest asking for passwords when there are no SFTP keys.
  (Robey Pointer, Jelmer Vernooij)

* Fix selftest run with 'python -O'.  (Martin Pool)

* Fix HTTP tests under Windows. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Make tests work even if HOME is not set (Aaron Bentley)

* Updated ``build_tree`` to use fixed line-endings for tests which read
  the file cotents and compare. Make some tests use this to pass under
  Windows. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Skip stat and symlink tests under Windows. (Alexander Belchenko)

* Delay in selftest/testhashcash is now issued under win32 and Cygwin.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Use terminal width to align verbose test output.  (Martin Pool)

* Blackbox tests are maintained within the bzrlib.tests.blackbox directory.
  If adding a new test script please add that to
  ``bzrlib.tests.blackbox.__init__``. (Robert Collins)

* Much better error message if one of the test suites can't be
  imported.  (Martin Pool)

* Make check now runs the test suite twice - once with the default locale,
  and once with all locales forced to C, to expose bugs. This is not
  trivially done within python, so for now its only triggered by running
  Make check. Integrators and packagers who wish to check for full
  platform support should run 'make check' to test the source.
  (Robert Collins)

* Tests can now run TestSkipped if they can't execute for any reason.
  (Martin Pool) (NB: TestSkipped should only be raised for correctable
  reasons - see the wiki spec ImprovingBzrTestSuite).

* Test SFTP with relative, absolute-in-homedir and absolute-not-in-homedir
  paths for the transport tests. Introduce blackbox remote SFTP tests that
  test the same permutations. (Robert Collins, Robey Pointer)

* Transport implementation tests are now independent of the local file
  system, which allows tests for esoteric transports, and for features
  not available in the local file system. They also repeat for variations
  on the URL scheme that can introduce issues in the transport code,
  see bzrlib.transport.TransportTestProviderAdapter() for this.
  (Robert Collins).

* ``TestCase.build_tree`` uses the transport interface to build trees,
  pass in a transport parameter to give it an existing connection.
  (Robert Collins).

Internals
*********

* WorkingTree.pull has been split across Branch and WorkingTree,
  to allow Branch only pulls. (Robert Collins)

* ``commands.display_command`` now returns the result of the decorated
  function. (Robert Collins)

* LocationConfig now has a ``set_user_option(key, value)`` call to save
  a setting in its matching location section (a new one is created
  if needed). (Robert Collins)

* Branch has two new methods, ``get_push_location`` and
  ``set_push_location`` to respectively, get and set the push location.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``commands.register_command`` now takes an optional flag to signal that
  the registrant is planning to decorate an existing command. When
  given multiple plugins registering a command is not an error, and
  the original command class (whether built in or a plugin based one) is
  returned to the caller. There is a new error 'MustUseDecorated' for
  signalling when a wrapping command should switch to the original
  version. (Robert Collins)

* Some option parsing errors will raise 'BzrOptionError', allowing
  granular detection for decorating commands. (Robert Collins).

* ``Branch.read_working_inventory`` has moved to
  ``WorkingTree.read_working_inventory``. This necessitated changes to
  ``Branch.get_root_id``, and a move of ``Branch.set_inventory`` to
  WorkingTree as well. To make it clear that a WorkingTree cannot always
  be obtained ``Branch.working_tree()`` will raise
  ``errors.NoWorkingTree`` if one cannot be obtained. (Robert Collins)

* All pending merges operations from Branch are now on WorkingTree.
  (Robert Collins)

* The follow operations from Branch have moved to WorkingTree::

      add()
      commit()
      move()
      rename_one()
      unknowns()

  (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.add.smart_add_branch`` is now ``smart_add_tree``. (Robert Collins)

* New "rio" serialization format, similar to rfc-822. (Martin Pool)

* Rename selftests to ``bzrlib.tests.test_foo``.  (John A Meinel, Martin
  Pool)

* ``bzrlib.plugin.all_plugins`` has been changed from an attribute to a
  query method. (Robert Collins)

* New options to read only the table-of-contents of a weave.
  (Denys Duchier)

* Raise NoSuchFile when someone tries to add a non-existent file.
  (Michael Ellerman)

* Simplify handling of DivergedBranches in ``cmd_pull()``.
  (Michael Ellerman)

* Branch.controlfile* logic has moved to lockablefiles.LockableFiles, which
  is exposed as ``Branch().control_files``. Also this has been altered with the
  controlfile pre/suffix replaced by simple method names like 'get' and
  'put'. (Aaron Bentley, Robert Collins).

* Deprecated functions and methods can now be marked as such using the
  ``bzrlib.symbol_versioning`` module. Marked method have their docstring
  updated and will issue a DeprecationWarning using the warnings module
  when they are used. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.osutils.safe_unicode`` now exists to provide parameter coercion
  for functions that need unicode strings. (Robert Collins)
