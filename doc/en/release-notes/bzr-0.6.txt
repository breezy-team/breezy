:Released: 2005-10-28

Improvements
************

* pull now takes --verbose to show you what revisions are added or removed
  (John A Meinel)

* merge now takes a --show-base option to include the base text in
  conflicts.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* The config files are now read using ConfigObj, so '=' should be used as
  a separator, not ':'.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* New 'bzr commit --strict' option refuses to commit if there are
  any unknown files in the tree.  To commit, make sure all files are
  either ignored, added, or deleted.  (Michael Ellerman)

* The config directory is now ~/.bazaar, and there is a single file
  ~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf storing email, editor and other preferences.
  (Robert Collins)

* 'bzr add' no longer takes a --verbose option, and a --quiet option
  has been added that suppresses all output.

* Improved zsh completion support in contrib/zsh, from Clint
  Adams.

* Builtin 'bzr annotate' command, by Martin Pool with improvements from
  Goffredo Baroncelli.

* 'bzr check' now accepts -v for verbose reporting, and checks for
  ghosts in the branch. (Robert Collins)

* New command 're-sign' which will regenerate the gpg signature for
  a revision. (Robert Collins)

* If you set ``check_signatures=require`` for a path in
  ``~/.bazaar/branches.conf`` then bzr will invoke your
  ``gpg_signing_command`` (defaults to gpg) and record a digital signature
  of your commit. (Robert Collins)

* New SFTP transport, based on Paramiko.  (Robey Pointer)

* 'bzr pull' now accepts '--clobber' which will discard local changes
  and make this branch identical to the source branch. (Robert Collins)

* Just give a quieter warning if a plugin can't be loaded, and
  put the details in .bzr.log.  (Martin Pool)

* 'bzr branch' will now set the branch-name to the last component of the
  output directory, if one was supplied.

* If the option ``post_commit`` is set to one (or more) python function
  names (must be in the bzrlib namespace), then they will be invoked
  after the commit has completed, with the branch and ``revision_id`` as
  parameters. (Robert Collins)

* Merge now has a retcode of 1 when conflicts occur. (Robert Collins)

* --merge-type weave is now supported for file contents.  Tree-shape
  changes are still three-way based.  (Martin Pool, Aaron Bentley)

* 'bzr check' allows the first revision on revision-history to have
  parents - something that is expected for cheap checkouts, and occurs
  when conversions from baz do not have all history.  (Robert Collins).

* 'bzr merge' can now graft unrelated trees together, if your specify
  0 as a base. (Aaron Bentley)

* 'bzr commit branch' and 'bzr commit branch/file1 branch/file2' now work
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Add '.sconsign*' to default ignore list.  (Alexander Belchenko)

* 'bzr merge --reprocess' minimizes conflicts

Testing
*******

* The 'bzr selftest --pattern' option for has been removed, now
  test specifiers on the command line can be simple strings, or
  regexps, or both. (Robert Collins)

* Passing -v to selftest will now show the time each test took to
  complete, which will aid in analysing performance regressions and
  related questions. (Robert Collins)

* 'bzr selftest' runs all tests, even if one fails, unless '--one'
  is given. (Martin Pool)

* There is a new method for TestCaseInTempDir, assertFileEqual, which
  will check that a given content is equal to the content of the named
  file. (Robert Collins)

* Fix test suite's habit of leaving many temporary log files in $TMPDIR.
  (Martin Pool)

Internals
*********

* New 'testament' command and concept for making gpg-signatures
  of revisions that are not tied to a particular internal
  representation.  (Martin Pool).

* Per-revision properties ('revprops') as key-value associated
  strings on each revision created when the revision is committed.
  Intended mainly for the use of external tools.  (Martin Pool).

* Config options have moved from bzrlib.osutils to bzrlib.config.
  (Robert Collins)

* Improved command line option definitions allowing explanations
  for individual options, among other things.  Contributed by
  Magnus Therning.

* Config options have moved from bzrlib.osutils to bzrlib.config.
  Configuration is now done via the config.Config interface:
  Depending on whether you have a Branch, a Location or no information
  available, construct a ``*Config``, and use its ``signature_checking``,
  ``username`` and ``user_email`` methods. (Robert Collins)

* Plugins are now loaded under bzrlib.plugins, not bzrlib.plugin, and
  they are made available for other plugins to use. You should not
  import other plugins during the ``__init__`` of your plugin though, as
  no ordering is guaranteed, and the plugins directory is not on the
  python path. (Robert Collins)

* Branch.relpath has been moved to WorkingTree.relpath. WorkingTree no
  no longer takes an inventory, rather it takes an option branch
  parameter, and if None is given will open the branch at basedir
  implicitly. (Robert Collins)

* Cleaner exception structure and error reporting.  Suggested by
  Scott James Remnant.  (Martin Pool)

* Branch.remove has been moved to WorkingTree, which has also gained
  ``lock_read``, ``lock_write`` and ``unlock`` methods for convenience.
  (Robert Collins)

* Two decorators, ``needs_read_lock`` and ``needs_write_lock`` have been
  added to the branch module. Use these to cause a function to run in a
  read or write lock respectively. (Robert Collins)

* ``Branch.open_containing`` now returns a tuple (Branch, relative-path),
  which allows direct access to the common case of 'get me this file
  from its branch'. (Robert Collins)

* Transports can register using ``register_lazy_transport``, and they
  will be loaded when first used.  (Martin Pool)

* 'pull' has been factored out of the command as ``WorkingTree.pull()``.
  A new option to WorkingTree.pull has been added, clobber, which will
  ignore diverged history and pull anyway.
  (Robert Collins)

* config.Config has a ``get_user_option`` call that accepts an option name.
  This will be looked up in branches.conf and bazaar.conf as normal.
  It is intended that this be used by plugins to support options -
  options of built in programs should have specific methods on the config.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``merge.merge_inner`` now has tempdir as an optional parameter.
  (Robert Collins)

* Tree.kind is not recorded at the top level of the hierarchy, as it was
  missing on EmptyTree, leading to a bug with merge on EmptyTrees.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``WorkingTree.__del__`` has been removed, it was non deterministic and not
  doing what it was intended to. See ``WorkingTree.__init__`` for a comment
  about future directions. (Robert Collins/Martin Pool)

* bzrlib.transport.http has been modified so that only 404 urllib errors
  are returned as NoSuchFile. Other exceptions will propagate as normal.
  This allows debuging of actual errors. (Robert Collins)

* bzrlib.transport.Transport now accepts *ONLY* URL-escaped relative paths
  to apis like 'put', 'get' and 'has'. This is to provide consistent
  behaviour - it operates on URLs only. (Robert Collins)

* Transports can register using ``register_lazy_transport``, and they
  will be loaded when first used.  (Martin Pool)

* ``merge_flex`` no longer calls ``conflict_handler.finalize()``, instead that
  is called by ``merge_inner``. This is so that the conflict count can be
  retrieved (and potentially manipulated) before returning to the caller
  of ``merge_inner``. Likewise 'merge' now returns the conflict count to the
  caller. (Robert Collins)

* ``revision.revision_graph`` can handle having only partial history for
  a revision - that is no revisions in the graph with no parents.
  (Robert Collins).

* New ``builtins.branch_files`` uses the standard ``file_list`` rules to
  produce a branch and a list of paths, relative to that branch
  (Aaron Bentley)

* New TestCase.addCleanup facility.

* New ``bzrlib.version_info`` tuple (similar to ``sys.version_info``),
  which can be used by programs importing bzrlib.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Better handling of branches in directories with non-ascii names.
  (Joel Rosdahl, Panagiotis Papadakos)

* Upgrades of trees with no commits will not fail due to accessing
  [-1] in the revision-history. (Andres Salomon)
