bzr 1.4 
#######

:Released: 2008-04-28

This release of Bazaar includes handy improvements to the speed of log and
status, new options for several commands, improved documentation, and better
hooks, including initial code for server-side hooks.  A number of bugs have
been fixed, particularly in interoperability between different formats or
different releases of Bazaar over there network.  There's been substantial
internal work in both the repository and network code to enable new features
and faster performance.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Pushing a branch in "dirstate" format (Branch5) over bzr+ssh would break
  if the remote server was < version 1.2.  This was due to a bug in the
  RemoteRepository.get_parent_map() fallback code.
  (John Arbash Meinel, Andrew Bennetts, #214894)


bzr 1.4rc2
##########

:Released: 2008-04-21

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr log -r ..X bzr://`` was failing, because it was getting a request
  for ``revision_id=None`` which was not a string.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #211661)

* Fixed a bug in handling ghost revisions when logging changes in a
  particular file.  (John Arbash Meinel, #209948)

* Fix error about "attempt to add line-delta in non-delta knit".
  (Andrew Bennetts, #205156)

* Fixed performance degradation in fetching from knit repositories to
  knits and packs due to parsing the entire revisions.kndx on every graph
  walk iteration fixed by using the Repository.get_graph API.  There was
  another regression in knit => knit fetching which re-read the index for
  every revision each side had in common.
  (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)


bzr 1.4rc1
##########

:Released: 2008-04-11

Changes
*******

* bzr main script cannot be imported (Benjamin Peterson)

* On GNU/Linux bzr additionally looks for plugins in arch-independent site
  directory. (Toshio Kuratomi)

* The ``set_rh`` branch hook is now deprecated. Please migrate
  any plugins using this hook to use an alternative, e.g.
  ``post_change_branch_tip``. (Ian Clatworthy)

* When a plugin cannot be loaded as the file path is not a valid
  python module name bzr will now strip a ``bzr_`` prefix from the
  front of the suggested name, as many plugins (e.g. bzr-svn)
  want to be installed without this prefix. It is a common mistake
  to have a folder named "bzr-svn" for that plugin, especially
  as this is what bzr branch lp:bzr-svn will give you. (James Westby,
  Andrew Cowie)

* UniqueIntegerBugTracker now appends bug-ids instead of joining
  them to the base URL. Plugins that register bug trackers may
  need a trailing / added to the base URL if one is not already there.
  (James Wesby, Andrew Cowie)

Features
********

* Added start_commit hook for mutable trees. (Jelmer Vernooij, #186422)

* ``status`` now accepts ``--no-pending`` to show the status without
  listing pending merges, which speeds up the command a lot on large
  histories.  (James Westby, #202830)

* New ``post_change_branch_tip`` hook that is called after the
  branch tip is moved but while the branch is still write-locked.
  See the User Reference for signature details.
  (Ian Clatworthy, James Henstridge)

* Reconfigure can convert a branch to be standalone or to use a shared
  repository.  (Aaron Bentley)

Improvements
************

* The smart protocol now has support for setting branches' revision info
  directly.  This should make operations like push slightly faster, and is a
  step towards server-side hooks.  The new request method name is
  ``Branch.set_last_revision_info``.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``bzr commit --fixes`` now recognises "gnome" as a tag by default.
  (James Westby, Andrew Cowie)

* ``bzr switch`` will attempt to find branches to switch to relative to the
  current branch. E.g. ``bzr switch branchname`` will look for
  ``current_branch/../branchname``. (Robert Collins, Jelmer Vernooij,
  Wouter van Heyst)

* Diff is now more specific about execute-bit changes it describes
  (Chad Miller)

* Fetching data over HTTP is a bit faster when urllib is used.  This is done
  by forcing it to recv 64k at a time when reading lines in HTTP headers,
  rather than just 1 byte at a time.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Log --short and --line are much faster when -r is not specified.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Merge is faster.  We no longer check a file's existence unnecessarily
  when merging the execute bit.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr status`` on an explicit list of files no longer shows pending
  merges, making it much faster on large trees. (John Arbash Meinel)

* The launchpad directory service now warns the user if they have not set
  their launchpad login and are trying to resolve a URL using it, just
  in case they want to do a write operation with it.  (James Westby)

* The smart protocol client is slightly faster, because it now only queries
  the server for the protocol version once per connection.  Also, the HTTP
  transport will now automatically probe for and use a smart server if
  one is present.  You can use the new ``nosmart+`` transport decorator
  to get the old behaviour.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* The ``version`` command takes a ``--short`` option to print just the
  version number, for easier use in scripts.  (Martin Pool)

* Various operations with revision specs and commands that calculate
  revnos and revision ids are faster.  (John A. Meinel, Aaron Bentley)

Bugfixes
********

* Add ``root_client_path`` parameter to SmartWSGIApp and
  SmartServerRequest.  This makes it possible to publish filesystem
  locations that don't exactly match URL paths. SmartServerRequest
  subclasses should use the new ``translate_client_path`` and
  ``transport_from_client_path`` methods when dealing with paths received
  from a client to take this into account.  (Andrew Bennetts, #124089)

* ``bzr mv a b`` can be now used also to rename previously renamed
  directories, not only files. (Lukáš Lalinský, #107967)

* ``bzr uncommit --local`` can now remove revisions from the local
  branch to be symmetric with ``bzr commit --local``.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #93412)

* Don't ask for a password if there is no real terminal.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #69851)

* Fix a bug causing a ValueError crash in ``parse_line_delta_iter`` when
  fetching revisions from a knit to pack repository or vice versa using
  bzr:// (including over HTTP or SSH).
  (#208418, Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool, Robert Collins)

* Fixed ``_get_line`` in ``bzrlib.smart.medium``, which was buggy.  Also
  fixed ``_get_bytes`` in the same module to use the push back buffer.
  These bugs had no known impact in normal use, but were problematic for
  developers working on the code, and were likely to cause real bugs sooner
  or later.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Implement handling of basename parameter for DefaultMail.  (James Westby)

* Incompatibility with Paramiko versions newer than 1.7.2 was fixed.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #213425)

* Launchpad locations (lp: URLs) can be pulled.  (Aaron Bentley, #181945)

* Merges that add files to deleted root directories complete.  They
  do create conflicts.  (Aaron Bentley, #210092)

* vsftp's return ``550 RNFR command failed.`` supported.
  (Marcus Trautwig, #129786)

Documentation
*************

* Improved documentation on send/merge relationship. (Peter Schuller)

* Minor fixes to the User Guide. (Matthew Fuller)

* Reduced the evangelism in the User Guide. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Added Integrating with Bazaar document for developers (Martin Albisetti)

API Breaks
**********

* Attempting to pull data from a ghost aware repository (e.g. knits) into a
  non-ghost aware repository such as weaves will now fail if there are
  ghosts.  (Robert Collins)

* ``KnitVersionedFile`` no longer accepts an ``access_mode`` parameter, and
  now requires the ``index`` and ``access_method`` parameters to be
  supplied. A compatible shim has been kept in the new function
  ``knit.make_file_knit``. (Robert Collins)

* Log formatters must now provide log_revision instead of show and
  show_merge_revno methods. The latter had been deprecated since the 0.17
  release. (James Westby)

* ``LoopbackSFTP`` is now called ``SocketAsChannelAdapter``.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``osutils.backup_file`` is removed. (Alexander Belchenko)

* ``Repository.get_revision_graph`` is deprecated, with no replacement
  method. The method was size(history) and not desirable. (Robert Collins)

* ``revision.revision_graph`` is deprecated, with no replacement function.
  The function was size(history) and not desirable. (Robert Collins)

* ``Transport.get_shared_medium`` is deprecated.  Use
  ``Transport.get_smart_medium`` instead.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``VersionedFile`` factories now accept a get_scope parameter rather
  than using a call to ``transaction_finished``, allowing the removal of
  the fixed list of versioned files per repository. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.annotate_iter`` is deprecated. While in principle this
  allowed lower memory use, all users of annotations wanted full file
  annotations, and there is no storage format suitable for incremental
  line-by-line annotation. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.clone_text`` is deprecated. This performance optimisation
  is no longer used - reading the content of a file that is undergoing a
  file level merge to identical state on two branches is rare enough, and
  not expensive enough to special case. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.clear_cache`` and ``enable_cache`` are deprecated.
  These methods added significant complexity to the ``VersionedFile``
  implementation, but were only used for optimising fetches from knits -
  which can be done from outside the knit layer, or via a caching
  decorator. As knits are not the default format, the complexity is no
  longer worth paying. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.create_empty`` is removed. This method presupposed a
  sensible mapping to a transport for individual files, but pack backed
  versioned files have no such mapping. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.get_graph`` is deprecated, with no replacement method.
  The method was size(history) and not desirable. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.get_graph_with_ghosts`` is deprecated, with no
  replacement method.  The method was size(history) and not desirable.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.get_parents`` is deprecated, please use
  ``VersionedFile.get_parent_map``. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.get_sha1`` is deprecated, please use
  ``VersionedFile.get_sha1s``. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.has_ghost`` is now deprecated, as it is both expensive
  and unused outside of a single test. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.iter_parents`` is now deprecated in favour of
  ``get_parent_map`` which can be used to instantiate a Graph on a
  VersionedFile. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFileStore`` no longer uses the transaction parameter given
  to most methods; amongst other things this means that the
  get_weave_or_empty method no longer guarantees errors on a missing weave
  in a readonly transaction, and no longer caches versioned file instances
  which reduces memory pressure (but requires more careful management by
  callers to preserve performance). (Robert Collins)

Testing
*******

* New -Dselftest_debug flag disables clearing of the debug flags during
  tests.  This is useful if you want to use e.g. -Dhpss to help debug a
  failing test.  Be aware that using this feature is likely to cause
  spurious test failures if used with the full suite. (Andrew Bennetts)

* selftest --load-list now uses a new more agressive test loader that will
  avoid loading unneeded modules and building their tests. Plugins can use
  this new loader by defining a load_tests function instead of a test_suite
  function. (a forthcoming patch will provide many examples on how to
  implement this).
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* selftest --load-list now does some sanity checks regarding duplicate test
  IDs and tests present in the list but not found in the actual test suite.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Slightly more concise format for the selftest progress bar, so there's
  more space to show the test name.  (Martin Pool) ::

    [2500/10884, 1fail, 3miss in 1m29s] test_revisionnamespaces.TestRev

* The test suite takes much less memory to run, and is a bit faster.  This
  is done by clearing most attributes of TestCases after running them, if
  they succeeded.  (Andrew Bennetts)

Internals
*********

* Added ``_build_client_protocol`` to ``_SmartClient``.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Added basic infrastructure for automatic plugin suggestion.
  (Martin Albisetti)

* If a ``LockableFiles`` object is not explicitly unlocked (for example
  because of a missing ``try/finally`` block, it will give a warning but
  not automatically unlock itself.  (Previously they did.)  This
  sometimes caused knock-on errors if for example the network connection
  had already failed, and should not be relied upon by code.
  (Martin Pool, #109520)

* ``make dist`` target to build a release tarball, and also
  ``check-dist-tarball`` and ``dist-upload-escudero``.  (Martin Pool)

* The ``read_response_tuple`` method of ``SmartClientRequestProtocol*``
  classes will now raise ``UnknownSmartMethod`` when appropriate, so that
  callers don't need to try distinguish unknown request errors from other
  errors.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``set_make_working_trees`` is now implemented provided on all repository
  implementations (Aaron Bentley)

* ``VersionedFile`` now has a new method ``get_parent_map`` which, like
  ``Graph.get_parent_map`` returns a dict of key:parents. (Robert Collins)
