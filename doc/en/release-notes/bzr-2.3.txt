bzr 2.3b3
#########

:2.3b3: NOT RELEASED YET

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

(none)

New Features
************

* Add --no-tree option to 'bzr push' and 'bzr init' for creating a
  new or mirrored branch without working trees.
  (Matthew Gordon, #506730)

* ``bzr config`` is a new command that displays the configuration options for
  a given directory. It accepts a glob to match against multiple options at
  once. It can also be used to set or delete a configuration option in any
  configuration file. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* New shortcut url schemes ``ubuntu:`` and ``debianlp:`` access source
  branches on Launchpad.  E.g. ``bzr branch ubuntu:foo`` gives you the source
  branch for project ``foo`` in the current distroseries for Ubuntu while
  ``bzr branch debianlp:lenny/foo`` gives you the source branch (on Launchpad)
  for project ``foo`` in Debian Lenny.
  (Barry Warsaw, #609186)

* Provide a configuration option "default_format" that controls the
  default format for new branches created with ``bzr init``.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #484101)

Improvements
************

Bug Fixes
*********

* Always set PATH in start_bzr.bat on Windows. (Matthäus G. Chajdas, #470264)

* ``bzr status -r X..Y`` was failing because RevisionTree didn't implement
  ``get_shelf_manager``. (John Arbash Meinel, #662053)

* Don't force openssh to use protocol=2, since that is now the default.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #561061)

* Fix ``KeyError: 'port'`` when getting the stored password for an http
  URL.
  (Martin Pool, #654684)

* Make ``bzr tag --quiet`` really quiet. (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #239523)

Documentation
*************

* Add documentation of the ability to edit hunks when shelving.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #517660)

* Be more specific about the meaning of revision ranges for ``bzr diff``.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #247282)

* Document the comment character in the .bzrignore file, including a
  workaround for ignore patterns that begin with #.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #621515)

API Changes
***********

* Add ``bzrlib.pyutils`` module with helper functions for some Python
  tasks such as resolving a dotted name to a Python object
  (``get_named_object``).  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``bzrlib.tests.ForwardingResult`` no longer exists.  Use
  ``testtools.ExtendedToOriginalDecorator`` instead.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``known_hooks_key_to_parent_and_attribute`` in ``bzrlib.hooks`` has been
  deprecated in favour of ``known_hooks.key_to_parent_and_attribute`` in
  the same module.  (Andrew Bennetts)

Internals
*********

* ``tools/fixed-in.py`` find a bug in NEWS from its number or a regexp
  matching the news entry and display the corresponding release, date, fix
  authors and the news entry itself. (Vincent Ladeuil)

Testing
*******

* Blank output section in scriptrunner tests no longer match any output.
  Instead, use '...' as a wildcard if you don't care about the output.
  (Martin Pool, #637830)

* Add an ignore_output keyword argument with default False to
  bzrlib.tests.script.ScriptRunner.run_script to specify if missing
  output does not need to be matched.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #662509)

* ``bzr test-script script`` is a new command that runs a shell-like script
  from an the ``script`` file. (Vincent Ladeuil)


bzr 2.3b2
#########

:2.3b2: 2010-10-08

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

* The ``bzr tags`` command sorts tag names using a natural sort by
  default (so tag2 sorts before tag10).  The previous default was
  strictly "asciibetical".  That behavior is still available as ``bzr tags
  --sort=alpha``. (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #640760)

* ``BzrDir.generate_backup_name`` has been deprecated and replaced by a
  private method. ``osutils.available_backup_name`` provides an extensible
  replacement. This allowed the deprecation of
  ``bzrlib.transform.get_backup_name``,
  ``bzrlib.transform._get_backup_name`` and
  ``bzrlib.transform.TreeTransformBase.has_named_child``.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

New Features
************

* Add ``mainline`` revision specifier, which selects the revision that
  merged a specified revision into the mainline.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Add ``annotate`` revision specifier, which selects the revision that
  introduced a specified line of a file.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Add ``-Dmem_dump`` debug flag, which uses meliae to dump memory to 
  a file upon an out of memory error.
  (Karl Bielefeldt, #551391)

* ``bzr status`` now displays a summary of existing shelves after
  the other status information. This is done using a ``post_status``
  hook.
  (Parth Malwankar, #403687)

* GNU lsh is now a supported lsh client; just set BZR_SSH to 'lsh'.
  Also, bzr will recognize if the 'ssh' comand is a symlink to lsh.
  (Matthew Gordon, #374700)

* The ``pull`` and ``update`` commands now take a ``--show-base``
  option that, in the case of conflicts, shows the base revision text.
  (Rory Yorke,  #202374)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr break-lock --force`` breaks the lock without prompting.  (Before
  using this, make sure the process holding the lock really is dead.)
  (Martin Pool, #397315)

* ``bzr remove`` now takes a ``--no-backup`` option for when you don't want it
  to backup anything, just delete it. This option used to be called ``--force``
  which is now deprecated.
  (Marius Kruger, #400554)

* When using the pycurl client module, Bazaar shows some of the text from
  http server error messages.
  (Martin Pool, #656667)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Don't force openssh to use protocol=2, since that is now the default.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #561061)

* Fix signature of RemoteBzrDir.create_workingtree to match that of its
  superclass.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, Martin Pool, #524627)

* Fix traceback with python-2.7's xmlrpclib
  (Toshio Kuratomi, #612096)

* Print junk rather than throwing a UnicodeDecodeError from ``bzr version-info``
  when using the rio format (with non-ascii information) on a non-utf-8
  terminal.  (Andrej A Antonov, #518609)

* Treat all IO, OS, and socket errors consistently when establishing
  SSH/SFTP connections via a subprocess.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``unshelve --preview`` now can show diff in a non-ascii encoding.
  (Andrej A Antonov, #518916)

* Deleting a versioned directory can leave orphans: unversioned files that
  were present don't have a parent anymore. The
  ``bzr.transform.orphan_policy`` configuration option controls the ``bzr``
  behaviour: ``conflict`` (the default) leave the orphans in place and
  create a conflict for the directory, ``move`` create orphans named
  ``<file>.~#~`` in a ``bzr-orphans`` directory at the root of the working
  tree.  (Vincent Ladeuil, #323111)

Improvements
************

Documentation
*************

* Correct the documentation for setting up the smart server with Apache.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #311518)

* Fix rst typos in bzrlib/help_topics/en/conflict-types.txt.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #660943)

* Provide more detailed help on the Launchpad plugin at "bzr help
  plugins/launchpad".  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #589379)

* Suggest ``bzr revert`` for restoring locally deleted files in help text
  for ``bzr update``.  (John C Barstow, #191466)

API Changes
***********

* ``WorkingTree`` methods ``pull``, ``update``, and ``_update_tree``
  now have an optional argument, ``show_base``, which is by default
  False.  This is flag is ultimately passed to ``merge.merge_inner``
  in each case. (Rory Yorke, #202374)

Internals
*********

* Small change to GroupCompressBlock to work more in terms of 'chunks'
  rather than 'content' for its compressed storage. (John Arbash Meinel)

* When running ``bzr selftest --subunit`` the subunit stream will no
  longer include the "log" information for tests which are considered to
  be 'successes' (success, xfail, skip, etc) (John Arbash Meinel)

Testing
*******

* Add a new simpler way to generate multiple test variations, by setting
  the `scenarios` attribute of a test class to a list of scenarios
  descriptions, then using `load_tests_apply_scenarios`.  (See the testing
  guide and `bzrlib.tests.scenarios`.) Simplify `test_http` using this.
  (Martin Pool, #597791)

* Add ``tests/ssl_certs/ca.crt`` to the required test files list. Test
  involving the pycurl https test server fail otherwise when running
  selftest from an installed version. (Vincent Ladeuil, #651706)

* Fix tests that failed when run under ``LANG=C``.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #632387)

* Skip tests that needs a bzr source tree when there isn't one. This is
  needed to succesfully run the test suite for installed versions.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #644855).

* Skip the tests that requires respecting the chmod bits when running as root.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #646133)

* Suppress the "maximum recursion depth exceeded in __subclasscheck__"
  warning on stderr emitted during ``test_dict_deepnested`` in
  ``bzrlib/tests/test__bencode.py``.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Use tests.TestCaseInTempDir for tests that requires disk resources.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #650001)

bzr 2.3b1
#########

:2.3b1: 2010-09-20

This is the first beta of the 2.3 series, leading up to a 2.3.0
release in January or February.  Beta releases are suitable for everyday use
but may cause some incompatibilities with plugins.  Some plugins may need
small updates to work with 2.3b1.

2.3b1 includes some performance improvements in both speed and memory
consumption, some preliminary support for generating a texinfo version of
the doc and better support for launchpad.  Many changes were made to make
our test suite more robust as well as numerous documentation fixes.  It
improves the common infrastructure for dealing with colocated named
branches and foreign branches.  We plan to continue with these themes
through the 2.3 series.

It also includes bug fixes for 2.0.6, 2.1.3 and 2.2.1 and over 40 fixes of
its own.


External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

(none)

New Features
************

* Added ``pre_status`` and ``post_status`` hooks. This allows plugins
  to register custom handlers which will be invoked before/after the
  standard status output is displayed. (Parth Malwankar)

* ``bzr break-lock --config [location]`` can now break config files
  locks. (Vincent Ladeuil, #525571)

* ``bzrlib.config.LockableConfig`` is a base class for config files that
  needs to be protected against multiple writers. All methods that
  change a configuration variable value must be decorated with
  @needs_write_lock (set_option() for example).
  (Vincent Ladeuil,  #525571)

* The ``lp:`` prefix will now use your known username (from
  ``bzr launchpad-login``) to expand ``~`` to your username.  For example:
  ``bzr launchpad-login user && bzr push lp:~/project/branch`` will now
  push to ``lp:~user/project/branch``.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* New development format ``development8-subtree`` which is similar to the 
  ``2a`` format and adds subtree support. (Jelmer Vernooij)

Improvements
************

* Allow using both ``--using`` and ``--diff-options``.
  (Matthäus G. Chajdas, #234708)

* Allow using non-integer bug ID with generic bug trackers.
  (Alexandre Garnier, #440472)

* ``bzr remove`` now just backs up changed files instead of exiting,
  forcing you to choose to either keep or delete them. Bazaar will now delete
  the files if they can easily be recovered using revert, otherwise they
  will be backed up (adding an extention of the form .~#~).
  (Marius Kruger, #400554)

* ``bzr revert`` and ``bzr status`` are up to 15% faster on large trees
  with many changes by not repeatedly building a list of all file-ids.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Decrease memory consumption when many chk index pages are loaded. (Such
  as during ``bzr co`` or ``bzr ls -R`` of a large tree.) Often we need to
  read many chk pages because the individual chk map nodes will be spread
  randomly. Peak memory for 'bzr ls -R' on a large tree dropped from 396MB
  down to 247MB, expect even more significant savings on 64-bit platforms.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Decrease peak memory during ``bzr send``. The old code was caching all
  text content and all inventory strings for all revisions before
  computing the diffs. Now we only cache as long as there is a child that
  will need them. Sending 2000 bzr revisions drops from 1.2GB peak to
  256MB peak. (John Arbash Meinel, #614576)

* ``DirState`` internals use a little bit less memory. For bzr.dev it
  drops the memory from 1MB down to about 800kB. And replaces a few
  thousand tuples and sets with StaticTuple.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Inventory entries now consume less memory (on 32-bit Ubuntu file entries
  have dropped from 68 bytes to 40, and directory entries from 120 bytes
  to 48).  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Reduce peak memory by one copy of compressed text when writing to pack
  repositories.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #566940)

* When building new working trees, default to reading from the repository
  rather than the source tree unless explicitly requested. (via
  ``--files-from`` and ``--hardlink`` for ``bzr branch`` and
  ``bzr checkout``. Generally, 2a format repositories extract
  content faster than seeking and reading content from another tree,
  especially in cold-cache situations. (John Arbash Meinel, #607298)

* Add ``__pycache__`` to the default ``ignores`` file. Future releases of
  Python will use this directory to store bytecodes.
  (Andrea Corbellini, #626687)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Additional merges after an unrelated branch has been merged with its
  history no longer crash when deleted files are involved.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, John Arbash Meinel, #375898)

* ``bzr add SYMLINK/FILE`` now works properly when the symlink points to a
  previously-unversioned directory within the tree: the directory is
  marked versioned too.
  (Martin Pool, #192859)

* ``bzr clean-tree`` issues a warning if it is unable to delete a file
  due to ``errno.EACCES`` instead of exiting with an error on Windows.
  (Parth Malwankar, #430785)

* ``bzr commit SYMLINK`` now works, rather than trying to commit the
  target of the symlink.
  (Martin Pool, John Arbash Meinel, #128562)

* ``bzr ignore PATTERNS`` exits with error if a bad pattern is supplied.
  ``InvalidPattern`` exception error message now shows faulting
  regular expression.
  (Parth Malwankar #300062)

* ``bzr upgrade`` now creates the ``backup.bzr`` directory with the same
  permissions as ``.bzr`` directory on a POSIX OS.
  (Parth Malwankar, #262450)

* CommitBuilder now uses the committer instead of _config.username to generate
  the revision-id.  (Aaron Bentley, #614404)

* Configuration files in ``${BZR_HOME}`` are now written in an atomic
  way which should help avoid problems with concurrent writers.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #525571)

* CommitBuilder now uses the committer instead of _config.username to generate
  the revision-id.  (Aaron Bentley, #614404)

* Configuration files in ``${BZR_HOME}`` are now protected against
  concurrent writers by using a lock. (Vincent Ladeuil, #525571)

* Cope with Microsoft FTP Server and VSFTPd that return reply '250
  Directory created' when mkdir succeeds.  (Martin Pool, #224373)

* `decode` parameter to get() method in FtpTransport and GioTransport classes
  is deprecated. (Alexander Belchenko)

* Don't print internal object name when print an invalid revision spec
  error.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #598701)

* Don't traceback when a lockdir's ``held/info`` file is corrupt (e.g.
  contains only NUL bytes).  Instead warn the user, and allow ``bzr
  break-lock`` to remove it.  (Andrew Bennetts, #619872)
  
* ``EPIPE`` can be raised during test server shutdown. This happened on
  gentoo only so far. (Vincent Ladeuil, #627277)

* Errors occurring during http(s) test server starts should now be
  handled cleanly. (Vincent Ladeuil, #392402)

* Fix ``AttributeError on parent.children`` when adding a file under a 
  directory that was a symlink in the previous commit.
  (Martin Pool, #192859)

* Fix ``AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'close'`` in
  ``_close_ssh_proc`` when using ``bzr+ssh://``.  This was causing
  connections to pre-1.6 bzr+ssh servers to fail, and causing warnings on
  stderr in some other circumstances.  (Andrew Bennetts, #633745)

* Fix spurious paramiko warning on hardy by ensuring that ``selftest``
  properly remove its warning filter. (Vincent Ladeuil, #625686)

* Fix ``AttributeError on parent.children`` when adding a file under a
  directory that was a symlink in the previous commit.
  (Martin Pool, #192859)

* Fix ``AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'close'`` in
  ``_close_ssh_proc`` when using ``bzr+ssh://``.  This was causing
  connections to pre-1.6 bzr+ssh servers to fail, and causing warnings on
  stderr in some other circumstances.  (Andrew Bennetts, #633745)

* Fix a problem in bzr's ``Makefile`` that meant syntax errors in some
  parts of bzr's source code could cause ``make check-nodocs`` to
  incorrectly return an exit code of 0.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #626667)

* ``HTTP/1.1`` test servers now set a ``Content-Length`` header to comply
  with pedantic ``HTTP/1.1`` clients. (Vincent Ladeuil, #568421)

* Most of the leaked threads during selftest are now fixed, allowing the
  full test suite to pass on gentoo.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #392127)

* Only call ``setlocale`` in the bzr startup script on posix systems. This
  avoids an issue with the newer windows C runtimes used by Python 2.6 and
  later which can mangle bytestrings printed to the console.
  (Martin [gz], #631350)

* `PathNotChild` should not give a traceback.
  (Martin Pool, #98735)

* Prevent ``CHKMap.apply_delta`` from generating non-canonical CHK maps,
  which can result in "missing referenced chk root keys" errors when
  fetching from repositories with affected revisions.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #522637)

* Raise ValueError instead of a string exception.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #586926)

* Repositories accessed via a smart server now reject being stacked on a
  repository in an incompatible format, as is the case when accessing them
  via other methods.  This was causing fetches from those repositories via
  a smart server (e.g. using ``bzr branch``) to receive invalid data.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #562380)

* Selftest with versions of subunit that support ``stopTestRun`` will no longer
  error. This error was caused by 2.0 not being updated when upstream
  python merged the end of run patch, which chose ``stopTestRun`` rather than
  ``done``. (Robert Collins, #571437)

* Stop ``AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'ElementTree'``
  being thrown from ``xml_serializer`` on certain cElementTree setups.
  (Martin [gz], #254278)

* strace test-helper tests cope with the new Ubuntu policy of not allowing
  users to attach to their own processes by default.
  (Martin Pool, #626679)

* Test classes like ``TestCase``, ``TestLoader``, and ``TestSuite`` should
  be available from ``bzrlib.tests.*``. They used to be, but were
  accidentally removed. (John Arbash Meinel, #627438)

* ``Transport.stat`` on a symlink, including a transport pointing directly
  to a symlink, now returns information about the symlink.
  (Martin Pool)

* Upgrading or fetching from a non-rich-root repository to a rich-root
  repository (e.g. from pack-0.92 to 2a) no longer fails with
  ``'Inter1and2Helper' object has no attribute 'source_repo'``.  This was
  a regression from Bazaar 2.1.  (Andrew Bennetts, #636930)
  
Documentation
*************

* Added a builder/writer sphinx extension that can generate texinfo files. The
  generated files are syntactically correct but the info navigation nodes
  needs more work. (Vincent Ladeuil, #219334)

* First tests defined for sphinx, including a new bzrlib.tests.features.sphinx
  to make the tests conditional.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Fix a lot of references in the docs to the old http://bazaar-vcs.org to
  the new http://bazaar.canonical.com or http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com
  (John Arbash Meinel, #617503)

API Changes
***********

* When passing a file to ``UTF8DirReader`` make sure to close the current
  directory file handle after the chdir fails. Otherwise when passing many
  filenames into a command line ``bzr status`` we would leak descriptors.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #583486)

* `ControlDirFormat` and  `ControlDir` have been split out of `BzrDirFormat`
  and `BzrDir`, respectively. `ControlDirFormat`
  and `ControlDir` should be used as the base classes for new non-.bzr
  implementations.

  `BzrDirFormat.register_control_format` has been renamed to
  `ControlDirFormat.register_format`.

  `BzrDirFormat.register_server_control_format` has been removed.

  Probing for control directories is now done by separate objects derived
  from `bzrlib.controldir.Prober` and registered using
  `bzrlib.controldir.ControlDirFormat.register_prober` or
  `bzrlib.controldir.ControlDirFormat.register_server_prober`.
  `BzrDirFormat.probe_transport` has been moved onto `Prober`.

  `BzrDirFormat.register_format` has been renamed to
  `BzrProber.register_bzrdir_format`.

  `bzrlib.bzrdir.network_format_registry` has been moved to
  `bzrlib.controldir`.

  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``bzrlib.transform.TreeTransformBase.final_kind``,
  ``bzrlib.transform.TreeTransform.tree_kind`` and
  ``bzrlib.transform.TransformPreview.tree_kind`` now return None instead
  of raising NoSuchFile.  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* BzrError subclasses no longer support the name "message" to be used
  as an argument for __init__ or in _fmt format specification as this
  breaks in some Python versions. errors.LockError.__init__ argument
  is now named "msg" instead of earlier "message".
  (Parth Malwankar, #603461)

* Configuration files should now use the ``from_string`` constructor rather
  than the ``file`` parameter of the ``_get_parser`` method. The later has
  been deprecated. ``from_string`` also accept a ``save=True`` parameter to
  have the configuration file immediately written to disk. 
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Deprecate treating a `PushResult` and `PullResult` as an integer for the
  relative change in revno.
  (Martin Pool)

* `FileInWrongBranch` is deprecated in favour of `PathNotChild` and no
  longer raised.
  (Martin Pool)

* ``IniBaseConfig`` objects should now use the ``from_string`` constructor
  the rather than the ``file`` parameter of the ``_get_parser`` method. The
  later has been deprecated. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* InventoryEntry instances now raise AttributeError if you try to assign
  to attributes that are irrelevant to that kind of entry.  e.g. setting
  ``symlink_target`` on an InventoryFile will fail.  It is still okay to
  read those attributes on any kind of InventoryEntry.  The complete list
  of affected attributes is: ``executable``, ``text_id``, ``text_sha1``,
  ``text_size`` (only valid for kind == file); ``symlink_target`` (only
  valid for kind == link); and ``reference_revision`` (only valid for kind
  == tree-reference).  (Andrew Bennetts)

* InventoryEntry objects no longer have ``_put_in_tar`` or
  ``_put_on_disk`` methods.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* The ``get_filename`` parameter in the ``config.IniBaseConfig``
  constructor has been deprecated, use the ``file_name`` parameter instead.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* `tree_files` and `internal_tree_files` are now deprecated in favor of
  `WorkingTree.open_containing_paths`.
  (Martin Pool)

Internals
*********

* Remove used and broken code path in ``BranchInitHookParams.__repr__``.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

Testing
*******

* Avoid spurious failures in ssh tests: wait for the SSH server to
  actually finish, rather than just waiting for it to negotiate the key
  exchange. (John Arbash Meinel, #626876)

* ``build_tree_contents`` can create symlinks.
  (Martin Pool, John Arbash Meinel)

* Catch socket errors to avoid
  bt.test_sftp_transport.SSHVendorBadConnection.test_bad_connection_ssh
  random failures. (Vincent Ladeuil, #601804)

* HTTP test servers will leak less threads (and sockets) and will not hang on
  AIX anymore. (Vincent Ladeuil, #405745)

* On platforms that don't support forking give a nice error message saying so
  when ``bzr selftest --parallel=fork`` is used. (Martin [gz], #528730)

* Rearrange thread leak detection code to eliminate global state and make it
  possible to extend the reporting. (Martin [gz], #633462)

* The old ``bzr selftest --benchmark`` option has been removed.
  <https://launchpad.net/bzr-usertest> is an actively-maintained
  macrobenchmark suite.
  (Martin Pool)

* The test suite now simply holds log files in memory, rather than writing them
  out to disk and then reading them back in and deleting them.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* The way ``bzr selftest --parallel`` generates N partitions of tests to
  run in parallel has changed.  Instead of splitting the list of tests at
  N-1 points, it distributes the tests one-by-one into the partitions in a
  round robin fashion.  This reduces the total time to run the tests in
  parallel because a series of slow tests in the test suite will be
  distributed evenly among the parallel test suites, rather than slowing
  down just one suite.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Tracebacks from a parameterized test are no longer reported against every
  parameterization of that test.  This was done by adding a hack to
  ``bzrlib.tests.clone_test`` so that it no longer causes
  testtools.TestCase instances to share a details dict.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #625574)
