Documentation
*************

.. Improved or updated documentation.

API Changes
***********

.. Changes that may require updates in plugins or other code that uses
   bzrlib.

Internals
*********

.. Major internal changes, unlikely to be visible to users or plugin 
   developers, but interesting for bzr developers.

Testing
*******

.. Fixes and changes that are only relevant to bzr's test framework and 
   suite.  This can include new facilities for writing tests, fixes to 
   spurious test failures and changes to the way things should be tested.


bzr 2.3.4
#########

:Codename: One and counting
:2.3.4: 2011-07-14

This is a bugfix release. Upgrading is recommended for all users of earlier
2.3 releases.

This mainly fixes bug #786980 which blocked the SRU process for Ubuntu Natty.

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

.. These may require users to change the way they use Bazaar.

New Features
************

.. New commands, options, etc that users may wish to try out.

Improvements
************

.. Improvements to existing commands, especially improved performance 
   or memory usage, or better results.

* Tweak an RPC implementation for ``Repository.get_parent_map``, it was
  doing an inefficient ``small_set.difference_update(large_set)`` when we
  can do ``small_set = small_set.difference(large_set)``. This speeds up
  discovery time by about 10%. (John Arbash Meinel)

Bug Fixes
*********

.. Fixes for situations where bzr would previously crash or give incorrect
   or undesirable results.

* Accept some differences for ``bound_location`` from the config files that
  were leading to a 'ReadOnlyError: A write attempt was made in a read only
  transaction' error.  (Vincent Ladeuil, #786980)

* Don't fail with traceback if `bzr serve` is running as a service on Windows,
  and there is no USERNAME, nor BZR_EMAIL or other whoami-related environment
  variables set. (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #660174)

Documentation
*************

.. Improved or updated documentation.

* Updated the "Using stacked branches" section of the user guide to
  describe committing to stacked branches and expanded its discussion of
  pushing a stacked branch.  (Andrew Bennetts)

API Changes
***********

.. Changes that may require updates in plugins or other code that uses
   bzrlib.

*******

.. Fixes and changes that are only relevant to bzr's test framework and 
   suite.  This can include new facilities for writing tests, fixes to 
   spurious test failures and changes to the way things should be tested.

* Remove the deprecation decorators for ``failUnlessExists`` and
  ``failIfExists``. The deprecation "will" occur in 2.4, not
  before. Providing the wrappers is enough as far as 2.3 is concerned.
  (Vincent Ladeuil #794960)

bzr 2.3.3
#########

:2.3.3: 2011-05-13

This is a bugfix release. Upgrading is recommended for all users of earlier
2.3 releases.

This fixed a bug in the test suite triggered by python-2.7 deprecating some
tests helpers.

Testing
*******

* Stop using `failIf`, `failUnless`, `failIfEqual`, etc, that give
  `PendingDeprecationWarnings` on Python2.7. 
  (Martin Pool, #760435)


bzr 2.3.2
#########

:2.3.2: 2011-05-12

This is a bugfix release. Upgrading is recommended for all users of earlier
2.3 releases.

This was never released due to bug #760435 interrupting the release process by
breaking the test suite under python-2.7 on natty.

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

None

New Features
************

None

Improvements
************

* Getting all entries from ``CHKInventory.iter_entries_by_dir()`` has been
  sped up dramatically for large trees. Iterating by dir is not the best
  way to load data from a CHK inventory, so it preloads all the items in
  the correct order. (With the gcc-tree, this changes it (re)reading 8GB
  of CHK data, down to just 150MB.) This has noticeable affects for things
  like building checkouts, etc.  (John Arbash Meinel, #737234)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Bazaar now infers the default user email address on Unix from the local
  account name plus the contents of ``/etc/mailname`` if that file exists.
  In particular, this means that committing as root through etckeeper will
  normally not require running ``bzr whoami`` first.
  (Martin Pool, #616878)

* ``bzr merge --preview --pull`` should respect the ``--preview`` option
  first, and not actually change the branch tip revision.
  (John Arbash Meinel, Dennis Duchier, #760152)

* ``bzr push`` into a repository (that doesn't have a branch), will no
  longer copy all revisions in the repository. Only the ones in the
  ancestry of the source branch, like it does in all other cases.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #465517)

* Fix ``UnboundLocalError: local variable 'lock_url' in wait_lock`` error,
  especially while trying to save configuration from QBzr.
  (Martin Pool, #733136)

* Fix "Unable to obtain lock" error when pushing to a bound branch if tags
  had changed.  Bazaar was attempting to open and lock the master branch
  twice in this case.  (Andrew Bennetts, #733350)

* Standalone bzr.exe installation on Windows: user can put additional python 
  libraries into ``site-packages`` subdirectory of the installation directory,
  this might be required for "installing" extra dependencies for some plugins.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #743256)

* When reporting a crash without apport, don't print the full list of
  plugins because it's often too long.
  (Martin Pool, #716389)


API Changes
***********

None.

Testing
*******

* FreeBSD8 has switched to python-2.7 which revealed a re-occurrence of a test
  failure in the launchpad plugin. ``xmlrpclib.py`` on natty carries a patch
  that is not in python-2.7 upstream and masked the issue. An additional fix
  has been added in the interim
  (<http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/tracker/issue8194> should be fixed
  in python > 2.7.1).  (Vincent Ladeuil, #654733)

bzr 2.3.1
#########

:2.3.1: 2011-03-10

This is a bugfix release. Upgrading is recommended for all users of earlier
2.3 releases.

Bug Fixes
*********

.. Fixes for situations where bzr would previously crash or give incorrect
   or undesirable results.

* Correctly resolve text conflicts for files in subdirs.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #715058)

* Fix "AssertionError: repository.user_url ... does not match URL from
  server response" when reusing a smart transport.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #726584)

* Restore proper logging of bytes transferred. We accidentally reset the
  counter when commands finished before we logged the total transferred.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #713258)

bzr 2.3.0
#########

:2.3.0: 2011-02-03

This release marks the start of another long-term-stable series. From here, we
will only make bugfix releases on the 2.3 series (2.3.1, etc, and support it
until August 2012), while 2.4 will become our new development series. The 2.1
and 2.2 series will also continue to get bugfixes. (Currently 2.0 is planned
to be EOLed circa September 2011 and will receive only critical bugfixes.)

This is a bugfix and polish release over the 2.2 series, with a large number
of bugs fixed (>130), and some performance improvements. Some features have
been enhanced including commits on stacked branches, upgrades of related
branches, shortcut URL schemes for ubuntu and debian on launchpad and better
conflict resolution.

Only bugfixes from other stables series have been included since 2.3b5 so all
known fixed bugs are included here.

Users are encouraged to upgrade from the other stable series.

bzr 2.3b5
#########

:2.3.b5: 2011-01-13

This is the fifth and **last** beta of the 2.3 series, leading up to a 2.3.0
release in February. Beta releases are suitable for everyday use but may cause
some incompatibilities with plugins.

2.3b5 includes bug fixes for committing to stacked branches, smoother upgrades
of multiple branches, compatibility with python-2.7, full test suite passing
on Ubuntu Natty and windows, less round-trips for several smart server
operations, better support text conflicts resolve actions and some more.

All known fixed bugs in other series (2.0, 2.1, 2.2) are also included here.

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

(none)

Improvements
************

* A redundant parent inventories calculation was removed from
  ``fetch.py``, as ``Repository.insert_stream`` already reports any
  missing inventories.  This removes at least one network roundtrip when
  pushing to a stacked branch.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``ControlDir.sprout`` no longer opens the target repository more than
  once.  This avoids some unnecessary IO, and removes a network roundtrip
  when doing ``bzr branch`` to a smart server URL.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``bzr modified`` now read-locks the working tree (and branch and
  repository) just once.  (Andrew Bennetts)
  
* ``bzr resolve`` now accepts ``--take-this`` and ``--take-other`` actions
  for text conflicts. This *replace* the whole file with the content
  designated by the action. This will *ignore* all differences that would
  have been merge cleanly otherwise. (Vincent Ladeuil, #638451)

* ``bzr tags``'s "sort" argument now allows registering custom sort
  methods using the ``bzrlib.tag.tag_sort_methods`` registry. 
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #701244)

* ``bt.test_http`` was breaking ``os.environ`` by erasing the values saved by
  ``TestCase`` leading to ``bt.test_import_tariff`` failures.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #690563)

* ``upgrade`` now upgrades dependent branches when a shared repository is
  specified. It also supports new options: ``--dry-run`` for showing what
  will happen and ``--clean`` to remove the backup directory on successful
  completion. (Ian Clatworthy, Matthew Fuller, #89830, #374734, #422450)

Bug Fixes
*********

.. Fixes for situations where bzr would previously crash or give incorrect
   or undesirable results.

* Avoid leaking SSH subprocess communication socket into unrelated child
  processes, which could cause bzr to hang on exit. (Max Bowsher, #696285)

* ``bzr break-lock`` on a corrupted lock file works correctly, rather than
  raising a PermissionDenied error. We were accidentally holding open the
  file we were trying to delete. (John Arbash Meinel, #659978)

* ``bzr update`` in a checkout of a readonly branch works again, without
  trying to set the tags in the master branch. This had been broken by the
  bug fix for bug #603395.  (John Arbash Meinel, #701212)

* Per-transport tests now prefer to use ``Transport.get_bytes()`` rather
  than ``Transport.get().read()``. The SFTP code uses an async message to
  close the file handle if you let the handle die from refcounting, while
  it uses a synchronous message if you close it directly. This should help
  prevent random test suite failures from race conditions.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #681047)

* Stop using ``bzrlib.tuned_gzip.GzipFile``. It is incompatible with
  python-2.7 and was only used for Knit format repositories, which haven't
  been recommended since 2007. The file itself will be removed in the next
  release. (John Arbash Meinel)

* The BZR_COLUMNS environment variable can be set to 0 to indicate no
  limitation on the width of the terminal.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #675652)

* Treat WSAECONNABORTED the same as WSAECONNRESET for the purposes of
  considering a smart data stream as being interrupted. This fixes a
  failure in the windows test suite, that was trying to ensure we cleanly
  handled a server disconnect.  (John Arbash Meinel, #581311, #686587)

* Unshelving changes that occur in a now-unversioned directory now restore
  the directory properly rather than crashing.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #389674)

* You are now able to commit directly to a stacked branch. Any needed
  parent inventories will be filled in as part of the commit process.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #375013)

Documentation
*************

* Better document the rules to update the bzr freshmeat page when
  doing a release. (Vincent Ladeuil, #690515)

API Changes
***********

* ``Branch.sprout``, ``BranchFormat.initalize`` and
  ``ControlDir.create_branch`` now take an optional ``repository`` keyword
  argument, and ``BranchFormat.open`` now takes an optional
  ``found_repository`` keyword argument.  These provide the repository
  object for new branch object to use (for cases when the caller has
  already opened that repository).  Implementations of these APIs will
  need to be updated to accept these arguments.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``bzrlib.tuned_gzip.GzipFile`` is now deprecated and will be removed in
  the bzr-2.4 series. Code that was using it can just use the python
  stdlib ``gzip.GzipFile``. (John Arbash Meinel)


Testing
*******

* ``bzrlib.tests`` defines ``isolated_environ`` with the definitions of all
  the environment variables the tests should care about. It also defines
  ``override_os_environ`` and ``restore_os_environ`` to properly implement
  isolation from ``os.environ`` for tests. ``bzrlib.tests`` now defines a
  ``DocTestSuite`` class using this facility for all ``bzrlib``
  doctests. (Vincent Ladeuil, #321320)

* Catch exceptions related to bug #637821 during test cleanup to avoid
  spurious failures. (Vincent Ladeuil, #686008).

* Check sphinx compatibility for tests requiring older sphinx versions.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #688072)

* ``test_onto_transport`` in the Launchpad plugin can now run with Python
  2.7. (Vincent Ladeuil, #654733)

* ``TestCase._captureVar`` and ``TestCase._old_env`` have been deleted due to
  bug #690563. Test writers are encouraged to use ``TestCase.overrideEnv``
  instead. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``TestDebuntuExpansions`` was escaping the test isolation by calling the
  wrong base class ``setUp``. (Vincent Ladeuil, #684662)

bzr 2.3b4
#########

:2.3.b4: 2010-12-03

This is the fourth beta of the 2.3 series, leading up to a 2.3.0 release in
February. Beta releases are suitable for everyday use but may cause some
incompatibilities with plugins.

2.3b4 includes bug fixes for the ``config`` command and conflict
resolution. More changes were made for the test scripts handling to make it
easier to add reproducing recipes to bugs.

It also includes bug fixes from the 2.2.2 release as well as the bug fixes
in the upcoming 2.0.7, 2.1.4 and 2.2.3 releases. This means that all known
fixed bugs at the time of this release are included.


External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

  (none)

Improvements
************

* Bazaar now caches a branch's tags while that branch is read-locked.
  This removes 1 network roundtrip from most interactions with a remote
  branch.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``bzr config <option>`` will now display only the value itself so scripts
  can use it to query the currently active configuration. Displaying several
  options matching a given regular expression is now controlled via the
  ``--all`` option.  (Vincent Ladeuil, bug #670251)

* ``bzr resolve`` now reports the number of conflicts resolved and the
  number of remaining conflicts. This provides a better feedback about the
  whole resolution process. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Read configuration files in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bazaar on Unix if there is
  already a directory there.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #195397)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Better message if there is an error while setting ownership of
  ``.bazaar`` directory. (Path Malwankar, #657553)

* ``bzr config`` properly displays list values. (Vincent Ladeuil, #672382)

* ``bzr config`` will now respect option policies when displaying the value
  and display the definition sections when appropriate.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #671050)

* Don't create commit message files in the current directory to avoid nasty
  interactions with emacs (which tries to establish the status of the file
  during the commit which breaks on windows). (Vincent Ladeuil, #673637)

* ``bzr resolve --take-other <file>`` will not crash anymore if ``<file>``
  is involved in a text conflict (but the conflict is still not
  resolved). (Vincent Ladeuil, #646961)

* Merge will now correctly locate a lca where there is a criss-cross merge
  of a new root. (Gary van der Merwe, #588698)

* Report error if non-ASCII command option given. (Rory Yorke, #140563)

* ``tools/check-newsbug.py`` is now based on ``lp:hydrazine`` and no longer
  crashes when encountering private bugs (they are just displayed as such).
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #354985)

Internals
*********

* ``BranchBuilder.build_snapshot`` now accepts parent_ids == [].
  This can be used to create a new root in the graph. (Gary van der Merwe)

* Old repository development formats
  RepositoryFormatCHK1 and RepositoryFormatCHK2 have been removed, and so
  have the corresponding metadir format options ``development-rich-root``,
  ``development6-rich-root``, and ``development7-rich-root``.

Testing
*******

* Add a null_output_matches_anything keyword argument with default False to
  bzrlib.tests.script.ScriptRunner.run_script to specify that the command
  output should not be checked (as opposed to expecting an empty output).
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #662509)

* Blank output section in scriptrunner tests no longer match any output.
  Instead, use '...' as a wildcard if you don't care about the output.
  (Martin Pool, #637830)

* Bump minimum testtools version required to run ``bzr selftest`` from 0.9.2
  to 0.9.5 which will allow tests that need the fixed unicode handling to be
  written. (Martin [gz])

* Introduce an ``overrideEnv()`` helper for tests that needs to change the
  environment variables while respecting the isolation rules. Get rid of
  TestCase._restoreEnvironment which is now useless.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #690563)

* Printing selftest results to a non-UTF-8 console will now escape characters
  that can't be encoded rather than aborting the test run with an exception.
  (Martin [gz], #633216)


bzr 2.3b3
#########

:2.3b3: 2010-11-05

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

(none)

New Features
************

* Add --no-tree option to 'bzr push' and 'bzr init' for creating a
  new or mirrored branch without working trees.
  (Matthew Gordon, #506730)

* ``bzr config`` is a new command that displays the configuration options for
  a given directory. It accepts a glob to match against multiple options at
  once. It can also be used to set or delete a configuration option in any
  configuration file. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* New shortcut URL schemes ``ubuntu:`` and ``debianlp:`` access source
  branches on Launchpad.  E.g. ``bzr branch ubuntu:foo`` gives you the source
  branch for project ``foo`` in the current distroseries for Ubuntu while
  ``bzr branch debianlp:lenny/foo`` gives you the source branch (on Launchpad)
  for project ``foo`` in Debian Lenny.
  (Barry Warsaw, #609186)

* Provide a configuration option "default_format" that controls the
  default format for new branches created with ``bzr init``.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #484101)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Always set PATH in start_bzr.bat on Windows. (Matthäus G. Chajdas, #470264)

* ``bzr status -r X..Y`` was failing because RevisionTree didn't implement
  ``get_shelf_manager``. (John Arbash Meinel, #662053)

* Correctly add directory contents when the name was previously added as a
  normal file, rather than throwing ``AttributeError: children`` during
  smart_add. (Martin [gz], #251864)

* Correctly handle the ``--directory`` option for all code paths of
  ``resolve`` and ``shelve``, this was previously ignored when paths were
  provided as parameters. When both are provided, ``--directory`` becomes
  the base directory for the other paths. (Vincent Ladeuil, #670851)

* Correctly set the Content-Type  header when HTTP POSTing to comply
  with stricter web frameworks. (Vincent Ladeuil, #665100)

* Don't force openssh to use protocol=2, since that is now the default.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #561061)

* Fix ``KeyError: 'port'`` when getting the stored password for an HTTP  URL.
  (Martin Pool, #654684)

* Make ``bzr tag --quiet`` really quiet. (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #239523)

* Missing files (files bzr add'ed and then OS deleted) are now shown in ``bzr
  status`` output. (Rory Yorke, #134168)

* ``NotBranchError`` no longer allows errors from calling
  ``bzrdir.open_repository()`` to propagate.  This is unhelpful at best,
  and at worst can trigger infinite loops in callers.  (Andrew Bennetts)
  
* The ``branch.tags.merge_to(target_branch)`` API used by plugins such as
  ``bzr-builddeb`` now propagates changes to the master branch of the
  target branch (if there is one).  This makes it consistent with the
  other tag APIs.  (Andrew Bennetts, #603395)

* Windows installers no longer requires the Microsoft vcredist to be
  installed. (Martin [gz], Gary van der Merwe, #632465)

Documentation
*************

* Add documentation of the ability to edit hunks when shelving.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #517660)

* Be more specific about the meaning of revision ranges for ``bzr diff``.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #247282)

* Document the comment character in the .bzrignore file, including a
  workaround for ignore patterns that begin with #.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #631515)

API Changes
***********

* Add ``bzrlib.pyutils`` module with helper functions for some Python
  tasks such as resolving a dotted name to a Python object
  (``get_named_object``).  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``bzrlib.tests.ForwardingResult`` no longer exists.  Use
  ``testtools.ExtendedToOriginalDecorator`` instead.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``known_hooks_key_to_parent_and_attribute`` in ``bzrlib.hooks`` has been
  deprecated in favour of ``known_hooks.key_to_parent_and_attribute`` in
  the same module.  (Andrew Bennetts)

Internals
*********

* ``tools/fixed-in.py`` find a bug in NEWS from its number or a regexp
  matching the news entry and display the corresponding release, date, fix
  authors and the news entry itself. (Vincent Ladeuil)

Testing
*******

* Blank output section in scriptrunner tests no longer match any output.
  Instead, use '...' as a wildcard if you don't care about the output.
  (Martin Pool, #637830)

* ``bzr test-script script`` is a new command that runs a shell-like script
  from an the ``script`` file. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Fix spurious test failures on babune related to the http pipe cleanup and
  get rid of some 'bytes left on the HTTP socket' useless log messages.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #655557)

* ``bzrlib.tests.per_workingtree.TestCaseWithWorkingTree.make_branch_builder``
  respects its ``relpath`` parameter. (Vincent Ladeuil)

bzr 2.3b2
#########

:2.3b2: 2010-10-08

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

* The ``bzr tags`` command sorts tag names using a natural sort by
  default (so tag2 sorts before tag10).  The previous default was
  strictly "asciibetical".  That behavior is still available as ``bzr tags
  --sort=alpha``. (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #640760)

* ``BzrDir.generate_backup_name`` has been deprecated and replaced by a
  private method. ``osutils.available_backup_name`` provides an extensible
  replacement. This allowed the deprecation of
  ``bzrlib.transform.get_backup_name``,
  ``bzrlib.transform._get_backup_name`` and
  ``bzrlib.transform.TreeTransformBase.has_named_child``.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

New Features
************

* Add ``mainline`` revision specifier, which selects the revision that
  merged a specified revision into the mainline.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Add ``annotate`` revision specifier, which selects the revision that
  introduced a specified line of a file.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Add ``-Dmem_dump`` debug flag, which uses meliae to dump memory to 
  a file upon an out of memory error.
  (Karl Bielefeldt, #551391)

* ``bzr status`` now displays a summary of existing shelves after
  the other status information. This is done using a ``post_status``
  hook.
  (Path Malwankar, #403687)

* GNU lsh is now a supported lsh client; just set BZR_SSH to 'lsh'.
  Also, bzr will recognize if the 'ssh' command is a symlink to lsh.
  (Matthew Gordon, #374700)

* The ``pull`` and ``update`` commands now take a ``--show-base``
  option that, in the case of conflicts, shows the base revision text.
  (Rory Yorke,  #202374)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr break-lock --force`` breaks the lock without prompting.  (Before
  using this, make sure the process holding the lock really is dead.)
  (Martin Pool, #397315)

* ``bzr remove`` now takes a ``--no-backup`` option for when you don't want it
  to backup anything, just delete it. This option used to be called ``--force``
  which is now deprecated.
  (Marius Kruger, #400554)

* When using the pycurl client module, Bazaar shows some of the text from
  HTTP server error messages.
  (Martin Pool, #656667)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Don't force openssh to use protocol=2, since that is now the default.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #561061)

* Fix signature of RemoteBzrDir.create_workingtree to match that of its
  superclass.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, Martin Pool, #524627)

* Fix traceback with python-2.7's xmlrpclib
  (Toshio Kuratomi, #612096)

* Print junk rather than throwing a UnicodeDecodeError from ``bzr version-info``
  when using the rio format (with non-ascii information) on a non-utf-8
  terminal.  (Andrej A Antonov, #518609)

* Treat all IO, OS, and socket errors consistently when establishing
  SSH/SFTP connections via a subprocess.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``unshelve --preview`` now can show diff in a non-ascii encoding.
  (Andrej A Antonov, #518916)

* Deleting a versioned directory can leave orphans: unversioned files that
  were present don't have a parent anymore. The
  ``bzr.transform.orphan_policy`` configuration option controls the ``bzr``
  behaviour: ``conflict`` (the default) leave the orphans in place and
  create a conflict for the directory, ``move`` create orphans named
  ``<file>.~#~`` in a ``bzr-orphans`` directory at the root of the working
  tree.  (Vincent Ladeuil, #323111)

*************

* Correct the documentation for setting up the smart server with Apache.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #311518)

* Fix rst typos in bzrlib/help_topics/en/conflict-types.txt.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #660943)

* Provide more detailed help on the Launchpad plugin at "bzr help
  plugins/launchpad".  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #589379)

* Suggest ``bzr revert`` for restoring locally deleted files in help text
  for ``bzr update``.  (John C Barstow, #191466)

API Changes
***********

* ``WorkingTree`` methods ``pull``, ``update``, and ``_update_tree``
  now have an optional argument, ``show_base``, which is by default
  False.  This is flag is ultimately passed to ``merge.merge_inner``
  in each case. (Rory Yorke, #202374)

Internals
*********

* Small change to GroupCompressBlock to work more in terms of 'chunks'
  rather than 'content' for its compressed storage. (John Arbash Meinel)

* When running ``bzr selftest --subunit`` the subunit stream will no
  longer include the "log" information for tests which are considered to
  be 'successes' (success, xfail, skip, etc) (John Arbash Meinel)

Testing
*******

* Add a new simpler way to generate multiple test variations, by setting
  the `scenarios` attribute of a test class to a list of scenarios
  descriptions, then using `load_tests_apply_scenarios`.  (See the testing
  guide and `bzrlib.tests.scenarios`.) Simplify `test_http` using this.
  (Martin Pool, #597791)

* Add ``tests/ssl_certs/ca.crt`` to the required test files list. Test
  involving the pycurl https test server fail otherwise when running
  selftest from an installed version. (Vincent Ladeuil, #651706)

* Fix tests that failed when run under ``LANG=C``.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #632387)

* Skip tests that needs a bzr source tree when there isn't one. This is
  needed to successfully run the test suite for installed versions.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #644855).

* Skip the tests that requires respecting the chmod bits when running as root.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #646133)

* Suppress the "maximum recursion depth exceeded in __subclasscheck__"
  warning on stderr emitted during ``test_dict_deepnested`` in
  ``bzrlib/tests/test__bencode.py``.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Use tests.TestCaseInTempDir for tests that requires disk resources.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #650001)

bzr 2.3b1
#########

:2.3b1: 2010-09-20

This is the first beta of the 2.3 series, leading up to a 2.3.0
release in January or February.  Beta releases are suitable for everyday use
but may cause some incompatibilities with plugins.  Some plugins may need
small updates to work with 2.3b1.

2.3b1 includes some performance improvements in both speed and memory
consumption, some preliminary support for generating a texinfo version of
the doc and better support for launchpad.  Many changes were made to make
our test suite more robust as well as numerous documentation fixes.  It
improves the common infrastructure for dealing with colocated named
branches and foreign branches.  We plan to continue with these themes
through the 2.3 series.

It also includes bug fixes for 2.0.6, 2.1.3 and 2.2.1 and over 40 fixes of
its own.


External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

(none)

New Features
************

* Added ``pre_status`` and ``post_status`` hooks. This allows plugins
  to register custom handlers which will be invoked before/after the
  standard status output is displayed. (Path Malwankar)

* ``bzr break-lock --config [location]`` can now break config files
  locks. (Vincent Ladeuil, #525571)

* ``bzrlib.config.LockableConfig`` is a base class for config files that
  needs to be protected against multiple writers. All methods that
  change a configuration variable value must be decorated with
  @needs_write_lock (set_option() for example).
  (Vincent Ladeuil,  #525571)

* The ``lp:`` prefix will now use your known username (from
  ``bzr launchpad-login``) to expand ``~`` to your username.  For example:
  ``bzr launchpad-login user && bzr push lp:~/project/branch`` will now
  push to ``lp:~user/project/branch``.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* New development format ``development8-subtree`` which is similar to the 
  ``2a`` format and adds subtree support. (Jelmer Vernooij)

Improvements
************

* Allow using both ``--using`` and ``--diff-options``.
  (Matthäus G. Chajdas, #234708)

* Allow using non-integer bug ID with generic bug trackers.
  (Alexandre Garnier, #440472)

* ``bzr remove`` now just backs up changed files instead of exiting,
  forcing you to choose to either keep or delete them. Bazaar will now delete
  the files if they can easily be recovered using revert, otherwise they
  will be backed up (adding an extension of the form .~#~).
  (Marius Kruger, #400554)

* ``bzr revert`` and ``bzr status`` are up to 15% faster on large trees
  with many changes by not repeatedly building a list of all file-ids.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Decrease memory consumption when many chk index pages are loaded. (Such
  as during ``bzr co`` or ``bzr ls -R`` of a large tree.) Often we need to
  read many chk pages because the individual chk map nodes will be spread
  randomly. Peak memory for 'bzr ls -R' on a large tree dropped from 396MB
  down to 247MB, expect even more significant savings on 64-bit platforms.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Decrease peak memory during ``bzr send``. The old code was caching all
  text content and all inventory strings for all revisions before
  computing the diffs. Now we only cache as long as there is a child that
  will need them. Sending 2000 bzr revisions drops from 1.2GB peak to
  256MB peak. (John Arbash Meinel, #614576)

* ``DirState`` internals use a little bit less memory. For bzr.dev it
  drops the memory from 1MB down to about 800kB. And replaces a few
  thousand tuples and sets with StaticTuple.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Inventory entries now consume less memory (on 32-bit Ubuntu file entries
  have dropped from 68 bytes to 40, and directory entries from 120 bytes
  to 48).  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Reduce peak memory by one copy of compressed text when writing to pack
  repositories.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #566940)

* When building new working trees, default to reading from the repository
  rather than the source tree unless explicitly requested. (via
  ``--files-from`` and ``--hardlink`` for ``bzr branch`` and
  ``bzr checkout``. Generally, 2a format repositories extract
  content faster than seeking and reading content from another tree,
  especially in cold-cache situations. (John Arbash Meinel, #607298)

* Add ``__pycache__`` to the default ``ignores`` file. Future releases of
  Python will use this directory to store bytecodes.
  (Andrea Corbellini, #626687)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Additional merges after an unrelated branch has been merged with its
  history no longer crash when deleted files are involved.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, John Arbash Meinel, #375898)

* ``bzr add SYMLINK/FILE`` now works properly when the symlink points to a
  previously-unversioned directory within the tree: the directory is
  marked versioned too.
  (Martin Pool, #192859)

* ``bzr clean-tree`` issues a warning if it is unable to delete a file
  due to ``errno.EACCES`` instead of exiting with an error on Windows.
  (Path Malwankar, #430785)

* ``bzr commit SYMLINK`` now works, rather than trying to commit the
  target of the symlink.
  (Martin Pool, John Arbash Meinel, #128562)

* ``bzr ignore PATTERNS`` exits with error if a bad pattern is supplied.
  ``InvalidPattern`` exception error message now shows faulting
  regular expression.
  (Path Malwankar #300062)

* ``bzr upgrade`` now creates the ``backup.bzr`` directory with the same
  permissions as ``.bzr`` directory on a POSIX OS.
  (Path Malwankar, #262450)

* CommitBuilder now uses the committer instead of _config.username to generate
  the revision-id.  (Aaron Bentley, #614404)

* Configuration files in ``${BZR_HOME}`` are now written in an atomic
  way which should help avoid problems with concurrent writers.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #525571)

* CommitBuilder now uses the committer instead of _config.username to generate
  the revision-id.  (Aaron Bentley, #614404)

* Configuration files in ``${BZR_HOME}`` are now protected against
  concurrent writers by using a lock. (Vincent Ladeuil, #525571)

* Cope with Microsoft FTP Server and VSFTPd that return reply '250
  Directory created' when mkdir succeeds.  (Martin Pool, #224373)

* `decode` parameter to get() method in FtpTransport and GioTransport classes
  is deprecated. (Alexander Belchenko)

* Don't print internal object name when print an invalid revision spec
  error.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #598701)

* Don't traceback when a lockdir's ``held/info`` file is corrupt (e.g.
  contains only NUL bytes).  Instead warn the user, and allow ``bzr
  break-lock`` to remove it.  (Andrew Bennetts, #619872)
  
* ``EPIPE`` can be raised during test server shutdown. This happened on
  gentoo only so far. (Vincent Ladeuil, #627277)

* Errors occurring during HTTP(S) test server starts should now be
  handled cleanly. (Vincent Ladeuil, #392402)

* Fix ``AttributeError on parent.children`` when adding a file under a 
  directory that was a symlink in the previous commit.
  (Martin Pool, #192859)

* Fix ``AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'close'`` in
  ``_close_ssh_proc`` when using ``bzr+ssh://``.  This was causing
  connections to pre-1.6 bzr+ssh servers to fail, and causing warnings on
  stderr in some other circumstances.  (Andrew Bennetts, #633745)

* Fix spurious paramiko warning on hardy by ensuring that ``selftest``
  properly remove its warning filter. (Vincent Ladeuil, #625686)

* Fix ``AttributeError on parent.children`` when adding a file under a
  directory that was a symlink in the previous commit.
  (Martin Pool, #192859)

* Fix ``AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'close'`` in
  ``_close_ssh_proc`` when using ``bzr+ssh://``.  This was causing
  connections to pre-1.6 bzr+ssh servers to fail, and causing warnings on
  stderr in some other circumstances.  (Andrew Bennetts, #633745)

* Fix a problem in bzr's ``Makefile`` that meant syntax errors in some
  parts of bzr's source code could cause ``make check-nodocs`` to
  incorrectly return an exit code of 0.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #626667)

* ``HTTP/1.1`` test servers now set a ``Content-Length`` header to comply
  with pedantic ``HTTP/1.1`` clients. (Vincent Ladeuil, #568421)

* Most of the leaked threads during selftest are now fixed, allowing the
  full test suite to pass on gentoo.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #392127)

* Only call ``setlocale`` in the bzr startup script on posix systems. This
  avoids an issue with the newer windows C runtimes used by Python 2.6 and
  later which can mangle bytestrings printed to the console.
  (Martin [gz], #631350)

* `PathNotChild` should not give a traceback.
  (Martin Pool, #98735)

* Prevent ``CHKMap.apply_delta`` from generating non-canonical CHK maps,
  which can result in "missing referenced chk root keys" errors when
  fetching from repositories with affected revisions.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #522637)

* Raise ValueError instead of a string exception.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #586926)

* Repositories accessed via a smart server now reject being stacked on a
  repository in an incompatible format, as is the case when accessing them
  via other methods.  This was causing fetches from those repositories via
  a smart server (e.g. using ``bzr branch``) to receive invalid data.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #562380)

* Selftest with versions of subunit that support ``stopTestRun`` will no longer
  error. This error was caused by 2.0 not being updated when upstream
  python merged the end of run patch, which chose ``stopTestRun`` rather than
  ``done``. (Robert Collins, #571437)

* Stop ``AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'ElementTree'``
  being thrown from ``xml_serializer`` on certain cElementTree setups.
  (Martin [gz], #254278)

* strace test-helper tests cope with the new Ubuntu policy of not allowing
  users to attach to their own processes by default.
  (Martin Pool, #626679)

* Test classes like ``TestCase``, ``TestLoader``, and ``TestSuite`` should
  be available from ``bzrlib.tests.*``. They used to be, but were
  accidentally removed. (John Arbash Meinel, #627438)

* ``Transport.stat`` on a symlink, including a transport pointing directly
  to a symlink, now returns information about the symlink.
  (Martin Pool)

* Upgrading or fetching from a non-rich-root repository to a rich-root
  repository (e.g. from pack-0.92 to 2a) no longer fails with
  ``'Inter1and2Helper' object has no attribute 'source_repo'``.  This was
  a regression from Bazaar 2.1.  (Andrew Bennetts, #636930)
  
Documentation
*************

* Added a builder/writer sphinx extension that can generate texinfo files. The
  generated files are syntactically correct but the info navigation nodes
  needs more work. (Vincent Ladeuil, #219334)

* First tests defined for sphinx, including a new bzrlib.tests.features.sphinx
  to make the tests conditional.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Fix a lot of references in the docs to the old http://bazaar-vcs.org to
  the new http://bazaar.canonical.com or http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com
  (John Arbash Meinel, #617503)

API Changes
***********

* When passing a file to ``UTF8DirReader`` make sure to close the current
  directory file handle after the chdir fails. Otherwise when passing many
  filenames into a command line ``bzr status`` we would leak descriptors.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #583486)

* `ControlDirFormat` and  `ControlDir` have been split out of `BzrDirFormat`
  and `BzrDir`, respectively. `ControlDirFormat`
  and `ControlDir` should be used as the base classes for new non-.bzr
  implementations.

  `BzrDirFormat.register_control_format` has been renamed to
  `ControlDirFormat.register_format`.

  `BzrDirFormat.register_server_control_format` has been removed.

  Probing for control directories is now done by separate objects derived
  from `bzrlib.controldir.Prober` and registered using
  `bzrlib.controldir.ControlDirFormat.register_prober` or
  `bzrlib.controldir.ControlDirFormat.register_server_prober`.
  `BzrDirFormat.probe_transport` has been moved onto `Prober`.

  `BzrDirFormat.register_format` has been renamed to
  `BzrProber.register_bzrdir_format`.

  `bzrlib.bzrdir.network_format_registry` has been moved to
  `bzrlib.controldir`.

  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``bzrlib.transform.TreeTransformBase.final_kind``,
  ``bzrlib.transform.TreeTransform.tree_kind`` and
  ``bzrlib.transform.TransformPreview.tree_kind`` now return None instead
  of raising NoSuchFile.  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* BzrError subclasses no longer support the name "message" to be used
  as an argument for __init__ or in _fmt format specification as this
  breaks in some Python versions. errors.LockError.__init__ argument
  is now named "msg" instead of earlier "message".
  (Path Malwankar, #603461)

* Configuration files should now use the ``from_string`` constructor rather
  than the ``file`` parameter of the ``_get_parser`` method. The later has
  been deprecated. ``from_string`` also accept a ``save=True`` parameter to
  have the configuration file immediately written to disk. 
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Deprecate treating a `PushResult` and `PullResult` as an integer for the
  relative change in revno.
  (Martin Pool)

* `FileInWrongBranch` is deprecated in favour of `PathNotChild` and no
  longer raised.
  (Martin Pool)

* ``IniBaseConfig`` objects should now use the ``from_string`` constructor
  the rather than the ``file`` parameter of the ``_get_parser`` method. The
  later has been deprecated. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* InventoryEntry instances now raise AttributeError if you try to assign
  to attributes that are irrelevant to that kind of entry.  e.g. setting
  ``symlink_target`` on an InventoryFile will fail.  It is still okay to
  read those attributes on any kind of InventoryEntry.  The complete list
  of affected attributes is: ``executable``, ``text_id``, ``text_sha1``,
  ``text_size`` (only valid for kind == file); ``symlink_target`` (only
  valid for kind == link); and ``reference_revision`` (only valid for kind
  == tree-reference).  (Andrew Bennetts)

* InventoryEntry objects no longer have ``_put_in_tar`` or
  ``_put_on_disk`` methods.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* The ``get_filename`` parameter in the ``config.IniBaseConfig``
  constructor has been deprecated, use the ``file_name`` parameter instead.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* `tree_files` and `internal_tree_files` are now deprecated in favor of
  `WorkingTree.open_containing_paths`.
  (Martin Pool)

Internals
*********

* Remove used and broken code path in ``BranchInitHookParams.__repr__``.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

Testing
*******

* Avoid spurious failures in ssh tests: wait for the SSH server to
  actually finish, rather than just waiting for it to negotiate the key
  exchange. (John Arbash Meinel, #626876)

* ``build_tree_contents`` can create symlinks.
  (Martin Pool, John Arbash Meinel)

* Catch socket errors to avoid
  bt.test_sftp_transport.SSHVendorBadConnection.test_bad_connection_ssh
  random failures. (Vincent Ladeuil, #601804)

* HTTP test servers will leak less threads (and sockets) and will not hang on
  AIX anymore. (Vincent Ladeuil, #405745)

* On platforms that don't support forking give a nice error message saying so
  when ``bzr selftest --parallel=fork`` is used. (Martin [gz], #528730)

* Rearrange thread leak detection code to eliminate global state and make it
  possible to extend the reporting. (Martin [gz], #633462)

* The old ``bzr selftest --benchmark`` option has been removed.
  <https://launchpad.net/bzr-usertest> is an actively-maintained
  macrobenchmark suite.
  (Martin Pool)

* The test suite now simply holds log files in memory, rather than writing them
  out to disk and then reading them back in and deleting them.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* The way ``bzr selftest --parallel`` generates N partitions of tests to
  run in parallel has changed.  Instead of splitting the list of tests at
  N-1 points, it distributes the tests one-by-one into the partitions in a
  round robin fashion.  This reduces the total time to run the tests in
  parallel because a series of slow tests in the test suite will be
  distributed evenly among the parallel test suites, rather than slowing
  down just one suite.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Tracebacks from a parameterized test are no longer reported against every
  parameterization of that test.  This was done by adding a hack to
  ``bzrlib.tests.clone_test`` so that it no longer causes
  testtools.TestCase instances to share a details dict.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #625574)
