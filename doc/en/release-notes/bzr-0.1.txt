bzr 0.1.1
#########

:Released: 2005-10-12

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix problem in pulling over HTTP from machines that do not
  allow directories to be listed.

* Avoid harmless warning about invalid hash cache after
  upgrading branch format.

Performance
***********

* Avoid some unnecessary HTTP operations in branch and pull.


bzr 0.1
#######

:Released: 2005-10-11

Notes
*****

* 'bzr branch' over HTTP initially gives a very high estimate
  of completion time but it should fall as the first few
  revisions are pulled in.  branch is still slow on
  high-latency connections.

Bug Fixes
*********

* bzr-man.py has been updated to work again. Contributed by
  Rob Weir.

* Locking is now done with fcntl.lockf which works with NFS
  file systems. Contributed by Harald Meland.

* When a merge encounters a file that has been deleted on
  one side and modified on the other, the old contents are
  written out to foo.BASE and foo.SIDE, where SIDE is this
  or OTHER. Contributed by Aaron Bentley.

* Export was choosing incorrect file paths for the content of
  the tarball, this has been fixed by Aaron Bentley.

* Commit will no longer commit without a log message, an
  error is returned instead. Contributed by Jelmer Vernooij.

* If you commit a specific file in a sub directory, any of its
  parent directories that are added but not listed will be
  automatically included. Suggested by Michael Ellerman.

* bzr commit and upgrade did not correctly record new revisions
  for files with only a change to their executable status.
  bzr will correct this when it encounters it. Fixed by
  Robert Collins

* HTTP tests now force off the use of ``http_proxy`` for the duration.
  Contributed by Gustavo Niemeyer.

* Fix problems in merging weave-based branches that have
  different partial views of history.

* Symlink support: working with symlinks when not in the root of a
  bzr tree was broken, patch from Scott James Remnant.

Improvements
************

* 'branch' now accepts a --basis parameter which will take advantage
  of local history when making a new branch. This allows faster
  branching of remote branches. Contributed by Aaron Bentley.

* New tree format based on weave files, called version 5.
  Existing branches can be upgraded to this format using
  'bzr upgrade'.

* Symlinks are now versionable. Initial patch by
  Erik Toubro Nielsen, updated to head by Robert Collins.

* Executable bits are tracked on files. Patch from Gustavo
  Niemeyer.

* 'bzr status' now shows unknown files inside a selected directory.
  Patch from Heikki Paajanen.

* Merge conflicts are recorded in .bzr. Two new commands 'conflicts'
  and 'resolve' have needed added, which list and remove those
  merge conflicts respectively. A conflicted tree cannot be committed
  in. Contributed by Aaron Bentley.

* 'rm' is now an alias for 'remove'.

* Stores now split out their content in a single byte prefixed hash,
  dropping the density of files per directory by 256. Contributed by
  Gustavo Niemeyer.

* 'bzr diff -r branch:URL' will now perform a diff between two branches.
  Contributed by Robert Collins.

* 'bzr log' with the default formatter will show merged revisions,
  indented to the right. Initial implementation contributed by Gustavo
  Niemeyer, made incremental by Robert Collins.


Internals
*********

* Test case failures have the exception printed after the log
  for your viewing pleasure.

* InventoryEntry is now an abstract base class, use one of the
  concrete InventoryDirectory etc classes instead.

* Branch raises an UnsupportedFormatError when it detects a
  bzr branch it cannot understand. This allows for precise
  handling of such circumstances.

* Remove RevisionReference class; ``Revision.parent_ids`` is now simply a
  list of their ids and ``parent_sha1s`` is a list of their corresponding
  sha1s (for old branches only at the moment.)

* New method-object style interface for Commit() and Fetch().

* Renamed ``Branch.last_patch()`` to ``Branch.last_revision()``, since
  we call them revisions not patches.

* Move ``copy_branch`` to ``bzrlib.clone.copy_branch``.  The destination
  directory is created if it doesn't exist.

* Inventories now identify the files which were present by
  giving the revision *of that file*.

* Inventory and Revision XML contains a version identifier.
  This must be consistent with the overall branch version
  but allows for more flexibility in future upgrades.

Testing
*******

* Removed testsweet module so that tests can be run after
  bzr installed by 'bzr selftest'.

* 'bzr selftest' command-line arguments can now be partial ids
  of tests to run, e.g. ``bzr selftest test_weave``

bzr 0.0.9
#########

:Released: 2005-09-23

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fixed "branch -r" option.

* Fix remote access to branches containing non-compressed history.
  (Robert Collins).

* Better reliability of HTTP server tests.  (John Arbash-Meinel)

* Merge graph maximum distance calculation fix.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Various minor bug in windows support have been fixed, largely in the
  test suite. Contributed by Alexander Belchenko.

Improvements
************

* Status now accepts a -r argument to give status between chosen
  revisions. Contributed by Heikki Paajanen.

* Revision arguments no longer use +/-/= to control ranges, instead
  there is a 'before' namespace, which limits the successive namespace.
  For example '$ bzr log -r date:yesterday..before:date:today' will
  select everything from yesterday and before today. Contributed by
  Robey Pointer

* There is now a bzr.bat file created by distutils when building on
  Windows. Contributed by Alexander Belchenko.

Internals
*********

* Removed uuid() as it was unused.

* Improved 'fetch' code for pulling revisions from one branch into
  another (used by pull, merged, etc.)


bzr 0.0.8
#########

:Released: 2005-09-20


Improvements
************

* Adding a file whose parent directory is not versioned will
  implicitly add the parent, and so on up to the root. This means
  you should never need to explicitly add a directory, they'll just
  get added when you add a file in the directory.  Contributed by
  Michael Ellerman.

* Ignore ``.DS_Store`` (contains Mac metadata) by default.
  (Nir Soffer)

* If you set ``BZR_EDITOR`` in the environment, it is checked in
  preference to EDITOR and the config file for the interactive commit
  editing program. Related to this is a bugfix where a missing program
  set in EDITOR would cause editing to fail, now the fallback program
  for the operating system is still tried.

* Files that are not directories/symlinks/regular files will no longer
  cause bzr to fail, it will just ignore them by default. You cannot add
  them to the tree though - they are not versionable.


Internals
*********

* Refactor XML packing/unpacking.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fixed 'bzr mv' by Ollie Rutherfurd.

* Fixed strange error when trying to access a nonexistent HTTP
  branch.

* Make sure that the hashcache gets written out if it can't be
  read.


Portability
***********

* Various Windows fixes from Ollie Rutherfurd.

* Quieten warnings about locking; patch from Matt Lavin.


bzr-0.0.7
#########

:Released: 2005-09-02

New Features
************

* ``bzr shell-complete`` command contributed by Clint Adams to
  help with intelligent shell completion.

* New expert command ``bzr find-merge-base`` for debugging merges.


Enhancements
************

* Much better merge support.

* merge3 conflicts are now reported with markers like '<<<<<<<'
  (seven characters) which is the same as CVS and pleases things
  like emacs smerge.


Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr upgrade`` no longer fails when trying to fix trees that
  mention revisions that are not present.

* Fixed bugs in listing plugins from ``bzr plugins``.

* Fix case of $EDITOR containing options for the editor.

* Fix log -r refusing to show the last revision.
  (Patch from Goffredo Baroncelli.)


Changes
*******

* ``bzr log --show-ids`` shows the revision ids of all parents.

* Externally provided commands on your $BZRPATH no longer need
  to recognize --bzr-usage to work properly, and can just handle
  --help themselves.


Library
*******

* Changed trace messages to go through the standard logging
  framework, so that they can more easily be redirected by
  libraries.



bzr-0.0.6
#########

:Released: 2005-08-18

New Features
************

* Python plugins, automatically loaded from the directories on
  ``BZR_PLUGIN_PATH`` or ``~/.bzr.conf/plugins`` by default.

* New 'bzr mkdir' command.

* Commit message is fetched from an editor if not given on the
  command line; patch from Torsten Marek.

* ``bzr log -m FOO`` displays commits whose message matches regexp
  FOO.

* ``bzr add`` with no arguments adds everything under the current directory.

* ``bzr mv`` does move or rename depending on its arguments, like
  the Unix command.

* ``bzr missing`` command shows a summary of the differences
  between two trees.  (Merged from John Arbash-Meinel.)

* An email address for commits to a particular tree can be
  specified by putting it into .bzr/email within a branch.  (Based
  on a patch from Heikki Paajanen.)


Enhancements
************

* Faster working tree operations.


Changes
*******

* 3rd-party modules shipped with bzr are copied within the bzrlib
  python package, so that they can be installed by the setup
  script without clashing with anything already existing on the
  system.  (Contributed by Gustavo Niemeyer.)

* Moved plugins directory to bzrlib/, so that there's a standard
  plugin directory which is not only installed with bzr itself but
  is also available when using bzr from the development tree.
  ``BZR_PLUGIN_PATH`` and ``DEFAULT_PLUGIN_PATH`` are then added to the
  standard plugins directory.

* When exporting to a tarball with ``bzr export --format tgz``, put
  everything under a top directory rather than dumping it into the
  current directory.   This can be overridden with the ``--root``
  option.  Patch from William Dodé and John Meinel.

* New ``bzr upgrade`` command to upgrade the format of a branch,
  replacing ``bzr check --update``.

* Files within store directories are no longer marked readonly on
  disk.

* Changed ``bzr log`` output to a more compact form suggested by
  John A Meinel.  Old format is available with the ``--long`` or
  ``-l`` option, patched by William Dodé.

* By default the commit command refuses to record a revision with
  no changes unless the ``--unchanged`` option is given.

* The ``--no-plugins``, ``--profile`` and ``--builtin`` command
  line options must come before the command name because they
  affect what commands are available; all other options must come
  after the command name because their interpretation depends on
  it.

* ``branch`` and ``clone`` added as aliases for ``branch``.

* Default log format is back to the long format; the compact one
  is available with ``--short``.


Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix bugs in committing only selected files or within a subdirectory.


bzr-0.0.5
#########

:Released:  2005-06-15

Changes
*******

* ``bzr`` with no command now shows help rather than giving an
  error.  Suggested by Michael Ellerman.

* ``bzr status`` output format changed, because svn-style output
  doesn't really match the model of bzr.  Now files are grouped by
  status and can be shown with their IDs.  ``bzr status --all``
  shows all versioned files and unknown files but not ignored files.

* ``bzr log`` runs from most-recent to least-recent, the reverse
  of the previous order.  The previous behaviour can be obtained
  with the ``--forward`` option.

* ``bzr inventory`` by default shows only filenames, and also ids
  if ``--show-ids`` is given, in which case the id is the second
  field.


Enhancements
************

* New 'bzr whoami --email' option shows only the email component
  of the user identification, from Jo Vermeulen.

* New ``bzr ignore PATTERN`` command.

* Nicer error message for broken pipe, interrupt and similar
  conditions that don't indicate an internal error.

* Add ``.*.sw[nop] .git .*.tmp *,v`` to default ignore patterns.

* Per-branch locks keyed on ``.bzr/branch-lock``, available in
  either read or write mode.

* New option ``bzr log --show-ids`` shows revision and file ids.

* New usage ``bzr log FILENAME`` shows only revisions that
  affected that file.

* Changed format for describing changes in ``bzr log -v``.

* New option ``bzr commit --file`` to take a message from a file,
  suggested by LarstiQ.

* New syntax ``bzr status [FILE...]`` contributed by Bartosz
  Oler.  File may be in a branch other than the working directory.

* ``bzr log`` and ``bzr root`` can be given an HTTP URL instead of
  a filename.

* Commands can now be defined by external programs or scripts
  in a directory on $BZRPATH.

* New "stat cache" avoids reading the contents of files if they
  haven't changed since the previous time.

* If the Python interpreter is too old, try to find a better one
  or give an error.  Based on a patch from Fredrik Lundh.

* New optional parameter ``bzr info [BRANCH]``.

* New form ``bzr commit SELECTED`` to commit only selected files.

* New form ``bzr log -r FROM:TO`` shows changes in selected
  range; contributed by John A Meinel.

* New option ``bzr diff --diff-options 'OPTS'`` allows passing
  options through to an external GNU diff.

* New option ``bzr add --no-recurse`` to add a directory but not
  their contents.

* ``bzr --version`` now shows more information if bzr is being run
  from a branch.


Bug Fixes
*********

* Fixed diff format so that added and removed files will be
  handled properly by patch.  Fix from Lalo Martins.

* Various fixes for files whose names contain spaces or other
  metacharacters.


Testing
*******

* Converted black-box test suites from Bourne shell into Python;
  now run using ``./testbzr``.  Various structural improvements to
  the tests.

* testbzr by default runs the version of bzr found in the same
  directory as the tests, or the one given as the first parameter.

* testbzr also runs the internal tests, so the only command
  required to check is just ``./testbzr``.

* testbzr requires python2.4, but can be used to test bzr running
  under a different version.

* Tests added for many other changes in this release.


Internal
********

* Included ElementTree library upgraded to 1.2.6 by Fredrik Lundh.

* Refactor command functions into Command objects based on HCT by
  Scott James Remnant.

* Better help messages for many commands.

* Expose ``bzrlib.open_tracefile()`` to start the tracefile; until
  this is called trace messages are just discarded.

* New internal function ``find_touching_revisions()`` and hidden
  command touching-revisions trace the changes to a given file.

* Simpler and faster ``compare_inventories()`` function.

* ``bzrlib.open_tracefile()`` takes a tracefilename parameter.

* New AtomicFile class.

* New developer commands ``added``, ``modified``.


Portability
***********

* Cope on Windows on python2.3 by using the weaker random seed.
  2.4 is now only recommended.


bzr-0.0.4
#########

:Released:  2005-04-22

Enhancements
************

* 'bzr diff' optionally takes a list of files to diff.  Still a bit
  basic.  Patch from QuantumG.

* More default ignore patterns.

* New 'bzr log --verbose' shows a list of files changed in the
  changeset.  Patch from Sebastian Cote.

* Roll over ~/.bzr.log if it gets too large.

* Command abbreviations 'ci', 'st', 'stat', '?' based on a patch
  by Jason Diamond.

* New 'bzr help commands' based on a patch from Denys Duchier.


Changes
*******

* User email is determined by looking at $BZREMAIL or ~/.bzr.email
  or $EMAIL.  All are decoded by the locale preferred encoding.
  If none of these are present user@hostname is used.  The host's
  fully-qualified name is not used because that tends to fail when
  there are DNS problems.

* New 'bzr whoami' command instead of username user-email.


Bug Fixes
*********

* Make commit safe for hardlinked bzr trees.

* Some Unicode/locale fixes.

* Partial workaround for ``difflib.unified_diff`` not handling
  trailing newlines properly.


Internal
********

* Allow docstrings for help to be in PEP0257 format.  Patch from
  Matt Brubeck.

* More tests in test.sh.

* Write profile data to a temporary file not into working
  directory and delete it when done.

* Smaller .bzr.log with process ids.


Portability
***********

* Fix opening of ~/.bzr.log on Windows.  Patch from Andrew
  Bennetts.

* Some improvements in handling paths on Windows, based on a patch
  from QuantumG.


bzr-0.0.3
#########

:Released:  2005-04-06

Enhancements
************

* New "directories" internal command lists versioned directories
  in the tree.

* Can now say "bzr commit --help".

* New "rename" command to rename one file to a different name
  and/or directory.

* New "move" command to move one or more files into a different
  directory.

* New "renames" command lists files renamed since base revision.

* New cat command contributed by janmar.

Changes
*******

* .bzr.log is placed in $HOME (not pwd) and is always written in
  UTF-8.  (Probably not a completely good long-term solution, but
  will do for now.)

Portability
***********

* Workaround for difflib bug in Python 2.3 that causes an
  exception when comparing empty files.  Reported by Erik Toubro
  Nielsen.

Internal
********

* Refactored inventory storage to insert a root entry at the top.

Testing
*******

* Start of shell-based black-box testing in test.sh.

bzr-0.0.2
#########

:Codename: "black cube"
:Released: 2005-03-31

Enhancements
************

* Default ignore list extended (see bzrlib/__init__.py).

* Patterns in .bzrignore are now added to the default ignore list,
  rather than replacing it.

* Ignore list isn't reread for every file.

* More help topics.

* Reinstate the 'bzr check' command to check invariants of the
  branch.

* New 'ignored' command lists which files are ignored and why;
  'deleted' lists files deleted in the current working tree.

* New global --profile option.

* Ignore patterns like './config.h' now correctly match files in
  the root directory only.

* Less file flushing and faster performance when writing logs and
  committing to stores.

* More useful verbose output from some commands.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix inverted display of 'R' and 'M' during 'commit -v'.

Portability
***********

* Include a subset of ElementTree-1.2.20040618 to make
  installation easier.

* Fix time.localtime call to work with Python 2.3 (the minimum
  supported).


bzr-0.0.0.69
