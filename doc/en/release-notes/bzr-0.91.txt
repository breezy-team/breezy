bzr 0.91
########

:Released: 2007-09-26

Bug Fixes
*********

* Print a warning instead of aborting the ``python setup.py install``
  process if building of a C extension is not possible.
  (Lukáš Lalinský, Alexander Belchenko)

* Fix commit ordering in corner case (Aaron Bentley, #94975)

* Fix ''bzr info bzr://host/'' and other operations on ''bzr://' URLs with
  an implicit port.  We were incorrectly raising PathNotChild due to
  inconsistent treatment of the ''_port'' attribute on the Transport object.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #133965)

* Make RemoteRepository.sprout cope gracefully with servers that don't
  support the ``Repository.tarball`` request.
  (Andrew Bennetts)


bzr 0.91rc2
###########

:Released: 2007-09-11

* Replaced incorrect tarball for previous release; a debug statement was left
  in bzrlib/remote.py.


bzr 0.91rc1
###########

:Released: 2007-09-11

Changes
*******

* The default branch and repository format has changed to
  ``dirstate-tags``, so tag commands are active by default.
  This format is compatible with Bazaar 0.15 and later.
  This incidentally fixes bug #126141.
  (Martin Pool)

* ``--quiet`` or ``-q`` is no longer a global option. If present, it
  must now appear after the command name. Scripts doing things like
  ``bzr -q missing`` need to be rewritten as ``bzr missing -q``.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

Features
********

* New option ``--author`` in ``bzr commit`` to specify the author of the
  change, if it's different from the committer. ``bzr log`` and
  ``bzr annotate`` display the author instead of the committer.
  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* In addition to global options and command specific options, a set of
  standard options are now supported. Standard options are legal for
  all commands. The initial set of standard options are:

  * ``--help`` or ``-h`` - display help message
  * ``--verbose`` or ``-v`` - display additional information
  * ``--quiet``  or ``-q`` - only output warnings and errors.

  Unlike global options, standard options can be used in aliases and
  may have command-specific help. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Verbosity level processing has now been unified. If ``--verbose``
  or ``-v`` is specified on the command line multiple times, the
  verbosity level is made positive the first time then increased.
  If ``--quiet`` or ``-q`` is specified on the command line
  multiple times, the verbosity level is made negative the first
  time then decreased. To get the default verbosity level of zero,
  either specify none of the above , ``--no-verbose`` or ``--no-quiet``.
  Note that most commands currently ignore the magnitude of the
  verbosity level but do respect *quiet vs normal vs verbose* when
  generating output. (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``Branch.hooks`` now supports ``pre_commit`` hook. The hook's signature
  is documented in BranchHooks constructor. (Nam T. Nguyen, #102747)

* New ``Repository.stream_knit_data_for_revisions`` request added to the
  network protocol for greatly reduced roundtrips when retrieving a set of
  revisions. (Andrew Bennetts)

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr plugins`` now lists the version number for each plugin in square
  brackets after the path. (Robert Collins, #125421)

* Pushing, pulling and branching branches with subtree references was not
  copying the subtree weave, preventing the file graph from being accessed
  and causing errors in commits in clones. (Robert Collins)

* Suppress warning "integer argument expected, got float" from Paramiko,
  which sometimes caused false test failures.  (Martin Pool)

* Fix bug in bundle 4 that could cause attempts to write data to wrong
  versionedfile.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Diffs generated using "diff -p" no longer break the patch parser.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* get_transport treats an empty possible_transports list the same as a non-
  empty one.  (Aaron Bentley)

* patch verification for merge directives is reactivated, and works with
  CRLF and CR files.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Accept ..\ as a path in revision specifiers. This fixes for example
  "-r branch:..\other-branch" on Windows.  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* ``BZR_PLUGIN_PATH`` may now contain trailing slashes.
  (Blake Winton, #129299)

* man page no longer lists hidden options (#131667, Aaron Bentley)

* ``uncommit --help`` now explains the -r option adequately.  (Daniel
  Watkins, #106726)

* Error messages are now better formatted with parameters (such as
  filenames) quoted when necessary. This avoids confusion when directory
  names ending in a '.' at the end of messages were confused with a
  full stop that may or not have been there. (Daniel Watkins, #129791)

* Fix ``status FILE -r X..Y``. (Lukáš Lalinský)

* If a particular command is an alias, ``help`` will show the alias
  instead of claiming there is no help for said alias. (Daniel Watkins,
  #133548)

* TreeTransform-based operations, like pull, merge, revert, and branch,
  now roll back if they encounter an error.  (Aaron Bentley, #67699)

* ``bzr commit`` now exits cleanly if a character unsupported by the
  current encoding is used in the commit message.  (Daniel Watkins,
  #116143)

* bzr send uses default values for ranges when only half of an elipsis
  is specified ("-r..5" or "-r5..").  (#61685, Aaron Bentley)

* Avoid trouble when Windows SSH calls itself 'plink' but no plink
  binary is present.  (Martin Albisetti, #107155)

* ``bzr remove`` should remove clean subtrees.  Now it will remove (without
  needing ``--force``) subtrees that contain no files with text changes or
  modified files.  With ``--force`` it removes the subtree regardless of
  text changes or unknown files. Directories with renames in or out (but
  not changed otherwise) will now be removed without needing ``--force``.
  Unknown ignored files will be deleted without needing ``--force``.
  (Marius Kruger, #111665)

* When two plugins conflict, the source of both the losing and now the
  winning definition is shown.  (Konstantin Mikhaylov, #5454)

* When committing to a branch, the location being committed to is
  displayed.  (Daniel Watkins, #52479)

* ``bzr --version`` takes care about encoding of stdout, especially
  when output is redirected. (Alexander Belchenko, #131100)

* Prompt for an FTP password if none is provided.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #137044)

* Reuse bound branch associated transport to avoid multiple
  connections.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #128076, #131396)

* Overwrite conflicting tags by ``push`` and ``pull`` if the
  ``--overwrite`` option is specified.  (Lukáš Lalinský, #93947)

* In checkouts, tags are copied into the master branch when created,
  changed or deleted, and are copied into the checkout when it is
  updated.  (Martin Pool, #93856, #93860)

* Print a warning instead of aborting the ``python setup.py install``
  process if building of a C extension is not possible.
  (Lukáš Lalinský, Alexander Belchenko)

Improvements
************

* Add the option "--show-diff" to the commit command in order to display
  the diff during the commit log creation. (Goffredo Baroncelli)

* ``pull`` and ``merge`` are much faster at installing bundle format 4.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``pull -v`` no longer includes deltas, making it much faster.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``send`` now sends the directive as an attachment by default.
  (Aaron Bentley, Lukáš Lalinský, Alexander Belchenko)

* Documentation updates (Martin Albisetti)

* Help on debug flags is now included in ``help global-options``.
  (Daniel Watkins, #124853)

* Parameters passed on the command line are checked to ensure they are
  supported by the encoding in use. (Daniel Watkins)

* The compression used within the bzr repository has changed from zlib
  level 9 to the zlib default level. This improves commit performance with
  only a small increase in space used (and in some cases a reduction in
  space). (Robert Collins)

* Initial commit no longer SHAs files twice and now reuses the path
  rather than looking it up again, making it faster.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* New option ``-c``/``--change`` for ``diff`` and ``status`` to show
  changes in one revision.  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* If versioned files match a given ignore pattern, a warning is now
  given. (Daniel Watkins, #48623)

* ``bzr status`` now has -S as a short name for --short and -V as a
  short name for --versioned. These have been added to assist users
  migrating from Subversion: ``bzr status -SV`` is now like
  ``svn status -q``.  (Daniel Watkins, #115990)

* Added C implementation of  ``PatienceSequenceMatcher``, which is about
  10x faster than the Python version. This speeds up commands that
  need file diffing, such as ``bzr commit`` or ``bzr diff``.
  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* HACKING has been extended with a large section on core developer tasks.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Add ``branches`` and ``standalone-trees`` as online help topics and
  include them as Concepts within the User Reference.
  (Paul Moore, Ian Clatworthy)

* ``check`` can detect versionedfile parent references that are
  inconsistent with revision and inventory info, and ``reconcile`` can fix
  them.  These faulty references were generated by 0.8-era releases,
  so repositories which were manipulated by old bzrs should be
  checked, and possibly reconciled ASAP.  (Aaron Bentley, Andrew Bennetts)

API Breaks
**********

* ``Branch.append_revision`` is removed altogether; please use
  ``Branch.set_last_revision_info`` instead.  (Martin Pool)

* CommitBuilder now advertises itself as requiring the root entry to be
  supplied. This only affects foreign repository implementations which reuse
  CommitBuilder directly and have changed record_entry_contents to require
  that the root not be supplied. This should be precisely zero plugins
  affected. (Robert Collins)

* The ``add_lines`` methods on ``VersionedFile`` implementations has changed
  its return value to include the sha1 and length of the inserted text. This
  allows the avoidance of double-sha1 calculations during commit.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``Transport.should_cache`` has been removed.  It was not called in the
  previous release.  (Martin Pool)

Testing
*******

* Tests may now raise TestNotApplicable to indicate they shouldn't be
  run in a particular scenario.  (Martin Pool)

* New function multiply_tests_from_modules to give a simpler interface
  to test parameterization.  (Martin Pool, Robert Collins)

* ``Transport.should_cache`` has been removed.  It was not called in the
  previous release.  (Martin Pool)

* NULL_REVISION is returned to indicate the null revision, not None.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Use UTF-8 encoded StringIO for log tests to avoid failures on
  non-ASCII committer names.  (Lukáš Lalinský)

Internals
*********

* ``bzrlib.plugin.all_plugins`` has been deprecated in favour of
  ``bzrlib.plugin.plugins()`` which returns PlugIn objects that provide
  useful functionality for determining the path of a plugin, its tests, and
  its version information. (Robert Collins)

* Add the option user_encoding to the function 'show_diff_trees()'
  in order to move the user encoding at the UI level. (Goffredo Baroncelli)

* Add the function make_commit_message_template_encoded() and the function
  edit_commit_message_encoded() which handle encoded strings.
  This is done in order to mix the commit messages (which is a unicode
  string), and the diff which is a raw string. (Goffredo Baroncelli)

* CommitBuilder now defaults to using add_lines_with_ghosts, reducing
  overhead on non-weave repositories which don't require all parents to be
  present. (Robert Collins)

* Deprecated method ``find_previous_heads`` on
  ``bzrlib.inventory.InventoryEntry``. This has been superseded by the use
  of ``parent_candidates`` and a separate heads check via the repository
  API. (Robert Collins)

* New trace function ``mutter_callsite`` will print out a subset of the
  stack to the log, which can be useful for gathering debug details.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.pack.ContainerWriter`` now tracks how many records have been
  added via a public attribute records_written. (Robert Collins)

* New method ``bzrlib.transport.Transport.get_recommended_page_size``.
  This provides a hint to users of transports as to the reasonable
  minimum data to read. In principle this can take latency and
  bandwidth into account on a per-connection basis, but for now it
  just has hard coded values based on the URL. (E.g., http:// has a large
  page size, file:// has a small one.) (Robert Collins)

* New method on ``bzrlib.transport.Transport`` ``open_write_stream`` allows
  incremental addition of data to a file without requiring that all the
  data be buffered in memory. (Robert Collins)

* New methods on ``bzrlib.knit.KnitVersionedFile``:
  ``get_data_stream(versions)``, ``insert_data_stream(stream)`` and
  ``get_format_signature()``.  These provide some infrastructure for
  efficiently streaming the knit data for a set of versions over the smart
  protocol.

* Knits with no annotation cache still produce correct annotations.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Three new methods have been added to ``bzrlib.trace``:
  ``set_verbosity_level``, ``get_verbosity_level`` and ``is_verbose``.
  ``set_verbosity_level`` expects a numeric value: negative for quiet,
  zero for normal, positive for verbose. The size of the number can be
  used to determine just how quiet or verbose the application should be.
  The existing ``be_quiet`` and ``is_quiet`` routines have been
  integrated into this new scheme. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Options can now be delcared with a ``custom_callback`` parameter. If
  set, this routine is called after the option is processed. This feature
  is now used by the standard options ``verbose`` and ``quiet`` so that
  setting one implicitly resets the other. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Rather than declaring a new option from scratch in order to provide
  custom help, a centrally registered option can be decorated using the
  new ``bzrlib.Option.custom_help`` routine. In particular, this routine
  is useful when declaring better help for the ``verbose`` and ``quiet``
  standard options as the base definition of these is now more complex
  than before thanks to their use of a custom callback. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Tree._iter_changes(specific_file=[]) now iterates through no files,
  instead of iterating through all files.  None is used to iterate through
  all files.  (Aaron Bentley)

* WorkingTree.revert() now accepts None to revert all files.  The use of
  [] to revert all files is deprecated.  (Aaron Bentley)
