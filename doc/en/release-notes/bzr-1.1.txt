bzr 1.1rc1
##########

:Released: 2008-01-05

Changes
*******

* Dotted revision numbers have been revised. Instead of growing longer with
  nested branches the branch number just increases. (eg instead of 1.1.1.1.1
  we now report 1.2.1.) This helps scale long lived branches which have many
  feature branches merged between them. (John Arbash Meinel)

* The syntax ``bzr diff branch1 branch2`` is no longer supported.
  Use ``bzr diff branch1 --new branch2`` instead. This change has
  been made to remove the ambiguity where ``branch2`` is in fact a
  specific file to diff within ``branch1``.

Features
********

* New option to use custom template-based formats in  ``bzr version-info``.
  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* diff '--using' allows an external diff tool to be used for files.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* New "lca" merge-type for fast everyday merging that also supports
  criss-cross merges.  (Aaron Bentley)

Improvements
************

* ``annotate`` now doesn't require a working tree. (Lukáš Lalinský,
  #90049)

* ``branch`` and ``checkout`` can now use files from a working tree to
  to speed up the process.  For checkout, this requires the new
  --files-from flag.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr diff`` now sorts files in alphabetical order.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr diff`` now works on branches without working trees. Tree-less
  branches can also be compared to each other and to working trees using
  the new diff options ``--old`` and ``--new``. Diffing between branches,
  with or without trees, now supports specific file filtering as well.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #6700)

* ``bzr pack`` now orders revision texts in topological order, with newest
  at the start of the file, promoting linear reads for ``bzr log`` and the
  like. This partially fixes #154129. (Robert Collins)

* Merge directives now fetch prerequisites from the target branch if
  needed.  (Aaron Bentley)

* pycurl now handles digest authentication.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``reconfigure`` can now convert from repositories.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``-l`` is now a short form for ``--limit`` in ``log``.  (Matt Nordhoff)

* ``merge`` now warns when merge directives cause cherrypicks.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``split`` now supported, to enable splitting large trees into smaller
  pieces.  (Aaron Bentley)

Bugfixes
********

* Avoid AttributeError when unlocking a pack repository when an error occurs.
  (Martin Pool, #180208)

* Better handle short reads when processing multiple range requests.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #179368)

* build_tree acceleration uses the correct path when a file has been moved.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``commit`` now succeeds when a checkout and its master branch share a
  repository.  (Aaron Bentley, #177592)

* Fixed error reporting of unsupported timezone format in
  ``log --timezone``. (Lukáš Lalinský, #178722)

* Fixed Unicode encoding error in ``ignored`` when the output is
  redirected to a pipe. (Lukáš Lalinský)

* Fix traceback when sending large response bodies over the smart protocol
  on Windows. (Andrew Bennetts, #115781)

* Fix ``urlutils.relative_url`` for the case of two ``file:///`` URLs
  pointed to different logical drives on Windows.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #90847)

* HTTP test servers are now compatible with the HTTP protocol version 1.1.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #175524)

* _KnitParentsProvider.get_parent_map now handles requests for ghosts
  correctly, instead of erroring or attributing incorrect parents to ghosts.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``merge --weave --uncommitted`` now works.  (Aaron Bentley)

* pycurl authentication handling was broken and incomplete. Fix handling of
  user:pass embedded in the URLs.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #177643)

* Files inside non-directories are now handled like other conflict types.
  (Aaron Bentley, #177390)

* ``reconfigure`` is able to convert trees into lightweight checkouts.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Reduce lockdir timeout to 0 when running ``bzr serve``.  (Andrew Bennetts,
  #148087)

* Test that the old ``version_info_format`` functions still work, even
  though they are deprecated. (John Arbash Meinel, ShenMaq, #177872)

* Transform failures no longer cause ImmortalLimbo errors (Aaron Bentley,
  #137681)

* ``uncommit`` works even when the commit messages of revisions to be
  removed use characters not supported in the terminal encoding.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* When dumb HTTP servers return whole files instead of the requested ranges,
  read the remaining bytes by chunks to avoid overflowing network buffers.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #175886)

Documentation
*************

* Minor tweaks made to the bug tracker integration documentation.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Reference material has now be moved out of the User Guide and added
  to the User Reference. The User Reference has gained 4 sections as
  a result: Authentication Settings, Configuration Settings, Conflicts
  and Hooks. All help topics are now dumped into text format in the
  doc/en/user-reference directory for those who like browsing that
  information in their editor. (Ian Clatworthy)

* *Using Bazaar with Launchpad* tutorial added. (Ian Clatworthy)

Internals
*********

* find_* methods available for BzrDirs, Branches and WorkingTrees.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Help topics can now be loaded from files.
  (Ian Clatworthy, Alexander Belchenko)

* get_parent_map now always provides tuples as its output.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Parent Providers should now implement ``get_parent_map`` returning a
  dictionary instead of ``get_parents`` returning a list.
  ``Graph.get_parents`` is now deprecated. (John Arbash Meinel,
  Robert Collins)

* Patience Diff now supports arbitrary python objects, as long as they
  support ``hash()``. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Reduce selftest overhead to establish test names by memoization.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

API Breaks
**********

Testing
*******

* Modules can now customise their tests by defining a ``load_tests``
  attribute. ``pydoc bzrlib.tests.TestUtil.TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule``
  for the documentation on this attribute. (Robert Collins)

* New helper function ``bzrlib.tests.condition_id_re`` which helps
  filter tests based on a regular expression search on the tests id.
  (Robert Collins)

* New helper function ``bzrlib.tests.condition_isinstance`` which helps
  filter tests based on class. (Robert Collins)

* New helper function ``bzrlib.tests.exclude_suite_by_condition`` which
  generalises the ``exclude_suite_by_re`` function. (Robert Collins)

* New helper function ``bzrlib.tests.filter_suite_by_condition`` which
  generalises the ``filter_suite_by_re`` function. (Robert Collins)

* New helper method ``bzrlib.tests.exclude_tests_by_re`` which gives a new
  TestSuite that does not contain tests from the input that matched a
  regular expression. (Robert Collins)

* New helper method ``bzrlib.tests.randomize_suite`` which returns a
  randomized copy of the input suite. (Robert Collins)

* New helper method ``bzrlib.tests.split_suite_by_re`` which splits a test
  suite into two according to a regular expression. (Robert Collins)

* Parametrize all HTTP tests for the transport implementations, the HTTP protocol versions (1.0 and 1.1) and the authentication schemes.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* The ``exclude_pattern`` and ``random_order`` parameters to the function
  ``bzrlib.tests.filter_suite_by_re`` have been deprecated. (Robert Collins)

* The method ``bzrlib.tests.sort_suite_by_re`` has been deprecated. It is
  replaced by the new helper methods added in this release. (Robert Collins)
