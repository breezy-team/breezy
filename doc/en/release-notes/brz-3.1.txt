brz 3.1.1
#########

:Codename: TBD
:3.1.1: UNRELEASED

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

.. These may require users to change the way they use Breezy.


New Features
************

.. New commands, options, etc that users may wish to try out.


Improvements
************

.. Improvements to existing commands, especially improved performance
   or memory usage, or better results.

 * Permission denied errors from GitLab during push are now properly
   recognized. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * Support rename and copy tracking when accessing Git
   repositories. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1760740)

 * A new method ``MergeProposal.get_source_revision`` has been added.
   (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * Add support for HTTP response code 308. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * Handle non-utf8 characters in Git repositories by surrogate escaping
   them.  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1489872)

 * ``BzrDir.sprout`` now correctly handles the ``revision_id``
   argument when ``source_branch`` is None. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * Warn when loading a plugin that is broken, but support
   ``suppress_warnings=load_plugin_failure`` to suppress it.
   (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1882528)

 * Add a basic ``svn:`` revision spec. Currently this doesn't work,
   but it prevents the DWIM revision specifier from treating "svn:"
   as a URL. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * New `pypi` directory that can be used to access remote repositories
   declared in pypi. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

Bug Fixes
*********

.. Fixes for situations where brz would previously crash or give incorrect
   or undesirable results.

 * Don't require ``ctypes.pythonapi`` to exist, as it's missing on newer
   versions of Pypy3. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * Prevent exceptions during commit when quilt is not installed but
   the tree contains quilt patches. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * Support pushing to Git repositories that do not yet exist,
   such as is the case on Launchpad repositories.
   (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * Fix compatibility with reference counting in Python 3.10.
   (Victor Stinner, #1904868)

 * Remove shebangs from non-executable files, add executable bits where
   needed. (Miro Hrončok)

Documentation
*************

.. Improved or updated documentation.

API Changes
***********

.. Changes that may require updates in plugins or other code that uses
   breezy.

 * ``BzrCommandError`` has been renamed to ``CommandError``.
   (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * The ``osutils.safe_file_id`` and ``osutils.safe_revision_id`` methods
   have been removed. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * File ids are no longer returned in ``Tree.walkdirs``.
   (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * ``WorkingTree.merge_from_branch``, ``Merge.do_merge`` and
   ``merge_inner`` now return a list of conflicts rather than number of
   conflicts.  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

Internals
*********

.. Major internal changes, unlikely to be visible to users or plugin 
   developers, but interesting for brz developers.

 * A new ``MergeProposal.post_comment`` function has been added, and
   is currently implemented for GitHub, GitLab and Launchpad.
   (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * Add a ``MemoryBranch`` implementation.  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * A new ``Workspace`` interface is now available for efficiently
   making changes to large working trees from automation.
   (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

Testing
*******

.. Fixes and changes that are only relevant to brz's test framework and 
   suite.  This can include new facilities for writing tests, fixes to 
   spurious test failures and changes to the way things should be tested.

 * Tests for most bzr-specific functionality has been moved to the
   ``breezy.bzr.tests`` module. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

brz 3.1.0
#########

:Codename: Nirvana
:3.1.0: 2020-05-21

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

.. These may require users to change the way they use Breezy.

* The ``brz init-repo`` command has been renamed to
  ``brz init-shared-repo`` to emphasize that it creates
  shared repositories rather than just any kind of repository.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

New Features
************

.. New commands, options, etc that users may wish to try out.

* A new ``brz land`` command can merge merge proposals on Launchpad,
  GitHub and GitLab sites. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1816213)

* The 'patch' command is now bundled with brz.
  Imported from bzrtools by Aaron Bentley. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* The 'quilt' plugin, extracted from brz-debian, is now
  bundled. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* A new ``calculate_revnos`` configuration option (defaults to enabled)
  can be used to disable revno display for branch formats that
  do not natively store revnos. This speeds up ``brz log`` on
  the Samba git branch by 33%.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* Directly read mtab rather than using psutil when trying to figure out
  filesystem types. This removes a dependency that not all users may
  have installed and speeds up import time since psutil brings in
  various other modules. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* ``brz diff`` now has a --color argument that can write
  color diff output. This is based on the cdiff code in
  bzrtools by Aaron Bentley.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #376594)

* Information about tree references can now be updated on remote
  branches. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* Warn the user when they attempt to use Breezy in a Subversion
  working copy. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* Add a basic Mercurial plugin that mentions that .hg repositories
  are unsupported when the user attempts to access one.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* The ``2a`` format now officially supports storing tree references.
  It always partially supported storing tree reference data,
  and would happily pull in tree reference data from other repository
  formats. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* A new ``fossil`` plugin has been added that warns users when they
  attempt to access Fossil repositories.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1848821)

* When pushing to Git repositories, symrefs are now followed.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1800393)

* New ``brz clone`` command, which clones everything under
  a control directory. I.e. all colocated branches, like
  ``git clone``. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #831939)

* ``brz sprout`` is now an alias for ``brz branch``.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* ``brz branch`` now accepts a ``-b`` flag with the
  name of the colocated branch to sprout.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1869977)

* Add a ``breezy.__main__`` module so that
  ``python3 -m breezy`` works. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

Improvements
************

.. Improvements to existing commands, especially improved performance
   or memory usage, or better results.

* A new ``--commit-message`` option has been added to
  ``brz propose``, for hosting sites that support it.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* Automatically upgrade to branch format 8 when setting branch references.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* The ``ssh`` configuration variable can be used to set the default
  SSH implementation. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #650757)

* ``locks.steal_dead`` is now enabled by default.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #220464)

* The substitution variables for the ``change_editor`` configuration
  option are now "{old_path}" and "{new_path}" rather than "@old_path" and
  "@new_path". The former is more consistent with the way substitutions
  work in other configuration options. The old syntax is still supported.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #708718)

* The ``brz inventory`` command now accepts a ``--include-root``
  argument to show the tree root. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* Fix support for reading Git repositories over HTTP without
  a smart server. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* CVS pserver URLs now indicate that the pserver protocol is not
  supported. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* Git repositories with submodules can now be imported into 2a
  branches; submodules are converted to nested trees.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #402814)

* Python 3 is now used by default to run scripts, etc. from the makefile.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* ``.git/config`` is now consulted to determine the users' identity
  for commits, and the gpg_signing_key. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* Ignore special files (fifos, block/character devices, sockets)
  when finding changes in Git working trees. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1857244)

* Parse error messages from stderr when a remote Git server
  hangs up. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)


Bug Fixes
*********

.. Fixes for situations where brz would previously crash or give incorrect
   or undesirable results.

* Print a sensible error message when conversion for an option fails
  (i.e. when a non-int is specified as the value for an integer
  parameter) (#237844, Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* Don't include timestamps in filenames when reporting on binary
  files in diff. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #71307)

* Ignore UnknownFormatErrors when scanning for control directories.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #468332)

* Fix fetching from remote git repositories in ``brz git-import``.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1836238)

* A new ``TreeEntry.is_unmodified`` method has added, which allows
  merge to check for unmodified files without relying
  on the .revision attribute that is not available for Git trees.
  This fixes LCA merges for Git repositories.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1826663)

* Fix passing of directories in specific_files to
  GitWorkingTree.iter_entries_by_dir(). (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1844054)

* Fix ``brz diff --using`` when {old_path} and {new_path} are not
  specified in the template. (#1847915, Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* Ignore ghost tags when interacting with remote Git repositories.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* Fix ``setup_ui=False`` when initializing Breezy.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1852647)

* Fix backwards compatibility with Bazaar by supporting the
  $BZR_EMAIL variable. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1869178)

* Cope with non-ascii characters in Git signatures.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1869533)

* Fix use of ``proxy_bypass`` on Python 3.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1878698)

* Create $XDG_HOME_DIR if it does not exist.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

   breezy.

* New ``Tree.get_transform`` method for getting a ``TreeTransform``
  object. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* The ``Tree.get_root_id`` method has been removed. Use
  ``Tree.path2id('')`` instead. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* ``Repository.find_branches`` now returns an iterator rather than a
  list. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #413970)

* New ``Tree.get_nested_tree`` method for retrieving a nested tree.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* The ``ControlDirFormat.register_server_prober`` method has been removed.

  stripping segment parameters from a URL.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* ``Tree.id2path`` has a new optional argument ``recurse``,
  that determines whether it scans through nested trees.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* ``VersionedFiles.add_content`` can now be used to add
  content from ``ContentFactory`` objects.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)
