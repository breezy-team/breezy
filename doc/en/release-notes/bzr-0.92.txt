bzr 0.92
########

:Released: 2007-11-05

Changes
*******

  * New uninstaller on Win32.  (Alexander Belchenko)


bzr 0.92rc1
###########

:Released: 2007-10-29

Changes
*******

* ``bzr`` now returns exit code 4 if an internal error occurred, and
  3 if a normal error occurred.  (Martin Pool)

* ``pull``, ``merge`` and ``push`` will no longer silently correct some
  repository index errors that occured as a result of the Weave disk format.
  Instead the ``reconcile`` command needs to be run to correct those
  problems if they exist (and it has been able to fix most such problems
  since bzr 0.8). Some new problems have been identified during this release
  and you should run ``bzr check`` once on every repository to see if you
  need to reconcile. If you cannot ``pull`` or ``merge`` from a remote
  repository due to mismatched parent errors - a symptom of index errors -
  you should simply take a full copy of that remote repository to a clean
  directory outside any local repositories, then run reconcile on it, and
  finally pull from it locally. (And naturally email the repositories owner
  to ask them to upgrade and run reconcile).
  (Robert Collins)

Features
********

* New ``knitpack-experimental`` repository format. This is interoperable with
  the ``dirstate-tags`` format but uses a smarter storage design that greatly
  speeds up many operations, both local and remote. This new format can be
  used as an option to the ``init``, ``init-repository`` and ``upgrade``
  commands. (Robert Collins)

* For users of bzr-svn (and those testing the prototype subtree support) that
  wish to try packs, a new ``knitpack-subtree-experimental`` format has also
  been added. This is interoperable with the ``dirstate-subtrees`` format.
  (Robert Collins)

* New ``reconfigure`` command. (Aaron Bentley)

* New ``revert --forget-merges`` command, which removes the record of a pending
  merge without affecting the working tree contents.  (Martin Pool)

* New ``bzr_remote_path`` configuration variable allows finer control of
  remote bzr locations than BZR_REMOTE_PATH environment variable.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* New ``launchpad-login`` command to tell Bazaar your Launchpad
  user ID.  This can then be used by other functions of the
  Launchpad plugin. (James Henstridge)

Performance
***********

* Commit in quiet mode is now slightly faster as the information to
  output is no longer calculated. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Commit no longer checks for new text keys during insertion when the
  revision id was deterministically unique. (Robert Collins)

* Committing a change which is not a merge and does not change the number of
  files in the tree is faster by utilising the data about whether files are
  changed to determine if the tree is unchanged rather than recalculating
  it at the end of the commit process. (Robert Collins)

* Inventory serialisation no longer double-sha's the content.
  (Robert Collins)

* Knit text reconstruction now avoids making copies of the lines list for
  interim texts when building a single text. The new ``apply_delta`` method
  on ``KnitContent`` aids this by allowing modification of the revision id
  such objects represent. (Robert Collins)

* Pack indices are now partially parsed for specific key lookup using a
  bisection approach. (Robert Collins)

* Partial commits are now approximately 40% faster by walking over the
  unselected current tree more efficiently. (Robert Collins)

* XML inventory serialisation takes 20% less time while being stricter about
  the contents. (Robert Collins)

* Graph ``heads()`` queries have been fixed to no longer access all history
  unnecessarily. (Robert Collins)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr+https://`` smart server across https now supported.
  (John Ferlito, Martin Pool, #128456)

* Mutt is now a supported mail client; set ``mail_client=mutt`` in your
  bazaar.conf and ``send`` will use mutt. (Keir Mierle)

* New option ``-c``/``--change`` for ``merge`` command for cherrypicking
  changes from one revision. (Alexander Belchenko, #141368)

* Show encodings, locale and list of plugins in the traceback message.
  (Martin Pool, #63894)

* Experimental directory formats can now be marked with
  ``experimental = True`` during registration. (Ian Clatworthy)

Documentation
*************

* New *Bazaar in Five Minutes* guide.  (Matthew Revell)

* The hooks reference documentation is now converted to html as expected.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Connection error reporting for the smart server has been fixed to
  display a user friendly message instead of a traceback.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #115601)

* Make sure to use ``O_BINARY`` when opening files to check their
  sha1sum. (Alexander Belchenko, John Arbash Meinel, #153493)

* Fix a problem with Win32 handling of the executable bit.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #149113)

* ``bzr+ssh://`` and ``sftp://`` URLs that do not specify ports explicitly
  no longer assume that means port 22.  This allows people using OpenSSH to
  override the default port in their ``~/.ssh/config`` if they wish.  This
  fixes a bug introduced in bzr 0.91.  (Andrew Bennetts, #146715)

* Commands reporting exceptions can now be profiled and still have their
  data correctly dumped to a file. For example, a ``bzr commit`` with
  no changes still reports the operation as pointless but doing so no
  longer throws away the profiling data if this command is run with
  ``--lsprof-file callgrind.out.ci`` say. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Fallback to FTP when paramiko is not installed and SFTP can't be used for
  ``tests/commands`` so that the test suite is still usable without
  paramiko.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #59150)

* Fix commit ordering in corner case. (Aaron Bentley, #94975)

* Fix long standing bug in partial commit when there are renames
  left in tree. (Robert Collins, #140419)

* Fix selftest semi-random noise during HTTP related tests.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #140614)

* Fix typo in ftp.py making the reconnection fail on temporary errors.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #154259)

* Fix failing test by comparing real paths to cover the case where the TMPDIR
  contains a symbolic link.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #141382).

* Fix log against smart server branches that don't support tags.
  (James Westby, #140615)

* Fix pycurl HTTP implementation by defining error codes from
  pycurl instead of relying on an old curl definition.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #147530)

* Fix 'unprintable error' message when displaying BzrCheckError and
  some other exceptions on Python 2.5.
  (Martin Pool, #144633)

* Fix ``Inventory.copy()`` and add test for it. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Handles default value for ListOption in cmd_commit.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #140432)

* HttpServer and FtpServer need to be closed properly or a listening socket
  will remain opened.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #140055)

* Monitor the .bzr directory created in the top level test
  directory to detect leaking tests.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #147986)

* The basename, not the full path, is now used when checking whether
  the profiling dump file begins with ``callgrind.out`` or not. This
  fixes a bug reported by Aaron Bentley on IRC. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Trivial fix for invoking command ``reconfigure`` without arguments.
  (Rob Weir, #141629)

* ``WorkingTree.rename_one`` will now raise an error if normalisation of the
  new path causes bzr to be unable to access the file. (Robert Collins)

* Correctly detect a NoSuchFile when using a filezilla server. (Gary van der
  Merwe)

API Breaks
**********

* ``bzrlib.index.GraphIndex`` now requires a size parameter to the
  constructor, for enabling bisection searches. (Robert Collins)

* ``CommitBuilder.record_entry_contents`` now requires the root entry of a
  tree be supplied to it, previously failing to do so would trigger a
  deprecation warning. (Robert Collins)

* ``KnitVersionedFile.add*`` will no longer cache added records even when
  enable_cache() has been called - the caching feature is now exclusively for
  reading existing data. (Robert Collins)

* ``ReadOnlyLockError`` is deprecated; ``LockFailed`` is usually more
  appropriate.  (Martin Pool)

* Removed ``bzrlib.transport.TransportLogger`` - please see the new
  ``trace+`` transport instead. (Robert Collins)

* Removed previously deprecated varargs interface to ``TestCase.run_bzr`` and
  deprecated methods ``TestCase.capture`` and ``TestCase.run_bzr_captured``.
  (Martin Pool)

* Removed previous deprecated ``basis_knit`` parameter to the
  ``KnitVersionedFile`` constructor. (Robert Collins)

* Special purpose method ``TestCase.run_bzr_decode`` is moved to the test_non_ascii
  class that needs it.
  (Martin Pool)

* The class ``bzrlib.repofmt.knitrepo.KnitRepository3`` has been folded into
  ``KnitRepository`` by parameters to the constructor. (Robert Collins)

* The ``VersionedFile`` interface now allows content checks to be bypassed
  by supplying check_content=False.  This saves nearly 30% of the minimum
  cost to store a version of a file. (Robert Collins)

* Tree's with bad state such as files with no length or sha will no longer
  be silently accepted by the repository XML serialiser. To serialise
  inventories without such data, pass working=True to write_inventory.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.fix_parents`` has been removed as a harmful API.
  ``VersionedFile.join`` will no longer accept different parents on either
  side of a join - it will either ignore them, or error, depending on the
  implementation. See notes when upgrading for more information.
  (Robert Collins)

Internals
*********

* ``bzrlib.transport.Transport.put_file`` now returns the number of bytes
  put by the method call, to allow avoiding stat-after-write or
  housekeeping in callers. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.xml_serializer.Serializer`` is now responsible for checking that
  mandatory attributes are present on serialisation and deserialisation.
  This fixes some holes in API usage and allows better separation between
  physical storage and object serialisation. (Robert Collins)

* New class ``bzrlib.errors.InternalBzrError`` which is just a convenient
  shorthand for deriving from BzrError and setting internal_error = True.
  (Robert Collins)

* New method ``bzrlib.mutabletree.update_to_one_parent_via_delta`` for
  moving the state of a parent tree to a new version via a delta rather than
  a complete replacement tree. (Robert Collins)

* New method ``bzrlib.osutils.minimum_path_selection`` useful for removing
  duplication from user input, when a user mentions both a path and an item
  contained within that path. (Robert Collins)

* New method ``bzrlib.repository.Repository.is_write_locked`` useful for
  determining if a repository is write locked. (Robert Collins)

* New method on ``bzrlib.tree.Tree`` ``path_content_summary`` provides a
  tuple containing the key information about a path for commit processing
  to complete. (Robert Collins)

* New method on XML serialisers, write_inventory_to_lines, which matches the
  API used by knits for adding content. (Robert Collins)

* New module ``bzrlib.bisect_multi`` with generic multiple-bisection-at-once
  logic, currently only available for byte-based lookup
  (``bisect_multi_bytes``). (Robert Collins)

* New helper ``bzrlib.tuned_gzip.bytes_to_gzip`` which takes a byte string
  and returns a gzipped version of the same. This is used to avoid a bunch
  of api friction during adding of knit hunks. (Robert Collins)

* New parameter on ``bzrlib.transport.Transport.readv``
  ``adjust_for_latency`` which changes readv from returning strictly the
  requested data to inserted return larger ranges and in forward read order
  to reduce the effect of network latency. (Robert Collins)

* New parameter yield_parents on ``Inventory.iter_entries_by_dir`` which
  causes the parents of a selected id to be returned recursively, so all the
  paths from the root down to each element of selected_file_ids are
  returned. (Robert Collins)

* Knit joining has been enhanced to support plain to annotated conversion
  and annotated to plain conversion. (Ian Clatworthy)

* The CommitBuilder method ``record_entry_contents`` now returns summary
  information about the effect of the commit on the repository. This tuple
  contains an inventory delta item if the entry changed from the basis, and a
  boolean indicating whether a new file graph node was recorded.
  (Robert Collins)

* The python path used in the Makefile can now be overridden.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Ian Clatworthy)

Testing
*******

* New transport implementation ``trace+`` which is useful for testing,
  logging activity taken to its _activity attribute. (Robert Collins)

* When running bzr commands within the test suite, internal exceptions are
  not caught and reported in the usual way, but rather allowed to propagate
  up and be visible to the test suite.  A new API ``run_bzr_catch_user_errors``
  makes this behavior available to other users.
  (Martin Pool)

* New method ``TestCase.call_catch_warnings`` for testing methods that
  raises a Python warning.  (Martin Pool)
