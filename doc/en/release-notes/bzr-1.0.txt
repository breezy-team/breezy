bzr 1.0rc3
##########

:Released: 2007-12-11

Changes
*******

* If a traceback occurs, users are now asked to report the bug
  through Launchpad (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr/), rather than
  by mail to the mailing list.
  (Martin Pool)

Bugfixes
********

* Fix Makefile rules for doc generation. (Ian Clatworthy, #175207)

* Give more feedback during long HTTP downloads by making readv deliver data
  as it arrives for urllib, and issue more requests for pycurl. High latency
  networks are better handled by urllib, the pycurl implementation give more
  feedback but also incur more latency.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #173010)

* Implement _make_parents_provider on RemoteRepository, allowing generating
  bundles against branches on a smart server.  (Andrew Bennetts, #147836)

Documentation
*************

* Improved user guide.  (Ian Clatworthy)

* The single-page quick reference guide is now available as a PDF.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

Internals
*********

* readv urllib HTTP implementation is now a real iterator above the
  underlying socket and deliver data as soon as it arrives. 'get' still
  wraps its output in a StringIO.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)


bzr 1.0rc2
##########

:Released: 2007-12-07

Improvements
************

* Added a --coverage option to selftest. (Andrew Bennetts)

* Annotate merge (merge-type=weave) now supports cherrypicking.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr commit`` now doesn't print the revision number twice. (Matt
  Nordhoff, #172612)

* New configuration option ``bugtracker_<tracker_abbrevation>_url`` to
  define locations of bug trackers that are not directly supported by
  bzr or a plugin. The URL will be treated as a template and ``{id}``
  placeholders will be replaced by specific bug IDs.  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* Support logging single merge revisions with short and line log formatters.
  (Kent Gibson)

* User Guide enhanced with suggested readability improvements from
  Matt Revell and corrections from John Arbash Meinel. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Quick Start Guide renamed to Quick Start Card, moved down in
  the catalog, provided in pdf and png format and updated to refer
  to ``send`` instead of ``bundle``. (Ian Clatworthy, #165080)

* ``switch`` can now be used on heavyweight checkouts as well as
  lightweight ones. After switching a heavyweight checkout, the
  local branch is a mirror/cache of the new bound branch and
  uncommitted changes in the working tree are merged. As a safety
  check, if there are local commits in a checkout which have not
  been committed to the previously bound branch, then ``switch``
  fails unless the ``--force`` option is given. This option is
  now also required if the branch a lightweight checkout is pointing
  to has been moved. (Ian Clatworthy)

Internals
*********

* New -Dhttp debug option reports HTTP connections, requests and responses.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* New -Dmerge debug option, which emits merge plans for merge-type=weave.

Bugfixes
********

* Better error message when running ``bzr cat`` on a non-existent branch.
  (Lukáš Lalinský, #133782)

* Catch OSError 17 (file exists) in final phase of tree transform and show
  filename to user.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #111758)

* Catch ShortReadvErrors while using pycurl. Also make readv more robust by
  allowing multiple GET requests to be issued if too many ranges are
  required.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #172701)

* Check for missing basis texts when fetching from packs to packs.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #165290)

* Fall back to showing e-mail in ``log --short/--line`` if the
  committer/author has only e-mail. (Lukáš Lalinský, #157026)

API Breaks
**********

* Deprecate not passing a ``location`` argument to commit reporters'
  ``started`` methods. (Matt Nordhoff)


bzr 1.0rc1
##########

:Released: 2007-11-30

Notes When Upgrading
********************

* The default repository format is now ``pack-0.92``.  This
  default is used when creating new repositories with ``init`` and
  ``init-repo``, and when branching over bzr+ssh or bzr+hpss.
  (See https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/164626)

  This format can be read and written by Bazaar 0.92 and later, and
  data can be transferred to and from older formats.

  To upgrade, please reconcile your repository (``bzr reconcile``), and then
  upgrade (``bzr upgrade``).

  ``pack-0.92`` offers substantially better scaling and performance than the
  previous knits format. Some operations are slower where the code already
  had bad scaling characteristics under knits, the pack format makes such
  operations more visible as part of being more scalable overall. We will
  correct such operations over the coming releases and encourage the filing
  of bugs on any operation which you observe to be slower in a packs
  repository. One particular case that we do not intend to fix is pulling
  data from a pack repository into a knit repository over a high latency
  link;  downgrading such data requires reinsertion of the file texts, and
  this is a classic space/time tradeoff. The current implementation is
  conservative on memory usage because we need to support converting data
  from any tree without problems.
  (Robert Collins, Martin Pool, #164476)

Changes
*******

* Disable detection of plink.exe as possible SSH vendor. Plink vendor
  still available if user selects it explicitly with BZR_SSH environment
  variable. (Alexander Belchenko, workaround for bug #107593)

* The pack format is now accessible as "pack-0.92", or "pack-0.92-subtree"
  to enable the subtree functions (for example, for bzr-svn).
  (Martin Pool)

Features
********

* New ``authentication.conf`` file holding the password or other credentials
  for remote servers. This can be used for SSH, SFTP, SMTP and other
  supported transports.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* New rich-root and rich-root-pack formats, recording the same data about
  tree roots that's recorded for all other directories.
  (Aaron Bentley, #164639)

* ``pack-0.92`` repositories can now be reconciled.
  (Robert Collins, #154173)

* ``switch`` command added for changing the branch a lightweight checkout
  is associated with and updating the tree to reflect the latest content
  accordingly. This command was previously part of the BzrTools plug-in.
  (Ian Clatworthy, Aaron Bentley, David Allouche)

* ``reconfigure`` command can now convert branches, trees, or checkouts to
  lightweight checkouts.  (Aaron Bentley)

Performance
***********

* Commit updates the state of the working tree via a delta rather than
  supplying entirely new basis trees. For commit of a single specified file
  this reduces the wall clock time for commit by roughly a 30%.
  (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

* Commit with many automatically found deleted paths no longer performs
  linear scanning for the children of those paths during inventory
  iteration. This should fix commit performance blowing out when many such
  paths occur during commit. (Robert Collins, #156491)

* Fetch with pack repositories will no longer read the entire history graph.
  (Robert Collins, #88319)

* Revert takes out an appropriate lock when reverting to a basis tree, and
  does not read the basis inventory twice. (Robert Collins)

* Diff does not require an inventory to be generated on dirstate trees.
  (Aaron Bentley, #149254)

* New annotate merge (--merge-type=weave) implementation is fast on
  versionedfiles without cached annotations, e.g. pack-0.92.
  (Aaron Bentley)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr merge`` now warns when it encounters a criss-cross merge.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr send`` now doesn't require the target e-mail address to be
  specified on the command line if an interactive e-mail client is used.
  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* ``bzr tags`` now prints the revision number for each tag, instead of
  the revision id, unless --show-ids is passed. In addition, tags can be
  sorted chronologically instead of lexicographically with --sort=time.
  (Adeodato Simó, #120231)

* Windows standalone version of bzr is able to load system-wide plugins from
  "plugins" subdirectory in installation directory. In addition standalone
  installer write to the registry (HKLM\SOFTWARE\Bazaar) useful info
  about paths and bzr version. (Alexander Belchenko, #129298)

Documentation
*************

Bug Fixes
*********

* A progress bar has been added for knitpack -> knitpack fetching.
  (Robert Collins, #157789, #159147)

* Branching from a branch via smart server now preserves the repository
  format. (Andrew Bennetts,  #164626)

* ``commit`` is now able to invoke an external editor in a non-ascii
  directory. (Daniel Watkins, #84043)

* Catch connection errors for FTP.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #164567)

* ``check`` no longer reports spurious unreferenced text versions.
  (Robert Collins, John A Meinel, #162931, #165071)

* Conflicts are now resolved recursively by ``revert``.
  (Aaron Bentley, #102739)

* Detect invalid transport reuse attempts by catching invalid URLs.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #161819)

* Deleting a file without removing it shows a correct diff, not a traceback.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Do no use timeout in HttpServer anymore.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #158972).

* Don't catch the exceptions related to the HTTP pipeline status before
  retrying an HTTP request or some programming errors may be masked.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #160012)

* Fix ``bzr rm`` to not delete modified and ignored files.
  (Lukáš Lalinský, #172598)

* Fix exception when revisionspec contains merge revisions but log
  formatter doesn't support merge revisions. (Kent Gibson, #148908)

* Fix exception when ScopeReplacer is assigned to before any members have
  been retrieved.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Fix multiple connections during checkout --lightweight.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #159150)

* Fix possible error in insert_data_stream when copying between
  pack repositories over bzr+ssh or bzr+http.
  KnitVersionedFile.get_data_stream now makes sure that requested
  compression parents are sent before any delta hunks that depend
  on them.
  (Martin Pool, #164637)

* Fix typo in limiting offsets coalescing for HTTP, leading to
  whole files being downloaded instead of parts.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #165061)

* FTP server errors don't error in the error handling code.
  (Robert Collins, #161240)

* Give a clearer message when a pull fails because the source needs
  to be reconciled.
  (Martin Pool, #164443)

* It is clearer when a plugin cannot be loaded because of its name, and a
  suggestion for an acceptable name is given. (Daniel Watkins, #103023)

* Leave port as None in transport objects if user doesn't
  specify a port in URLs.
  (vincent Ladeuil, #150860)

* Make sure Repository.fetch(self) is properly a no-op for all
  Repository implementations. (John Arbash Meinel, #158333)

* Mark .bzr directories as "hidden" on Windows.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #71147)

* ``merge --uncommitted`` can now operate on a single file.
  (Aaron Bentley, Lukáš Lalinský, #136890)

* Obsolete packs are now cleaned up by pack and autopack operations.
  (Robert Collins, #153789)

* Operations pulling data from a smart server where the underlying
  repositories are not both annotated/both unannotated will now work.
  (Robert Collins, #165304).

* Reconcile now shows progress bars. (Robert Collins, #159351)

* ``RemoteBranch`` was not initializing ``self._revision_id_to_revno_map``
  properly. (John Arbash Meinel, #162486)

* Removing an already-removed file reports the file does not exist. (Daniel
  Watkins, #152811)

* Rename on Windows is able to change filename case.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #77740)

* Return error instead of a traceback for ``bzr log -r0``.
  (Kent Gibson, #133751)

* Return error instead of a traceback when bzr is unable to create
  symlink on some platforms (e.g. on Windows).
  (Alexander Belchenko, workaround for #81689)

* Revert doesn't crash when restoring a single file from a deleted
  directory. (Aaron Bentley)

* Stderr output via logging mechanism now goes through encoded wrapper
  and no more uses utf-8, but terminal encoding instead. So all unicode
  strings now should be readable in non-utf-8 terminal.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #54173)

* The error message when ``move --after`` should be used makes how to do so
  clearer. (Daniel Watkins, #85237)

* Unicode-safe output from ``bzr info``. The output will be encoded
  using the terminal encoding and unrepresentable characters will be
  replaced by '?'. (Lukáš Lalinský, #151844)

* Working trees are no longer created when pushing into a local no-trees
  repo. (Daniel Watkins, #50582)

* Upgrade util/configobj to version 4.4.0.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #151208).

* Wrap medusa FTP test server as an FTPServer feature.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #157752)

API Breaks
**********

* ``osutils.backup_file`` is deprecated. Actually it's not used in bzrlib
  during very long time. (Alexander Belchenko)

* The return value of
  ``VersionedFile.iter_lines_added_or_present_in_versions`` has been
  changed. Previously it was an iterator of lines, now it is an iterator of
  (line, version_id) tuples. This change has been made to aid reconcile and
  fetch operations. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.repository.get_versioned_file_checker`` is now private.
  (Robert Collins)

* The Repository format registry default has been removed; it was previously
  obsoleted by the bzrdir format default, which implies a default repository
  format.
  (Martin Pool)

Internals
*********

* Added ``ContainerSerialiser`` and ``ContainerPushParser`` to
  ``bzrlib.pack``.  These classes provide more convenient APIs for generating
  and parsing containers from streams rather than from files.  (Andrew
  Bennetts)

* New module ``lru_cache`` providing a cache for use by tasks that need
  semi-random access to large amounts of data. (John A Meinel)

* InventoryEntry.diff is now deprecated.  Please use diff.DiffTree instead.
