brz 3.0.0
#########

:Codename: Pelican
:3.0.1: NOT RELEASED YET

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

 * The bzr command has been renamed to brz, to prevent
   clashes with upstream Bazaar.
   (Martin Packman, Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * The --prefix/-p argument for ``bzr diff`` now defaults to -p1 rather
   than -p0. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1695126)

 * The ``brz register-branch`` command from the Launchpad plugin has been
   removed, because it has not worked for at least five years: it relies on
   password authentication rather than SSO, the relevant systems no longer
   have firewall-level access to the outside world, and in general the
   Mirrored branch type is deprecated.  Either just push the branch to
   Launchpad or use code imports instead
   (https://help.launchpad.net/VcsImports).
   (Colin Watson, #254567, #483689)

 * brz no longer supports building the C extensions using Pyrex.
   Only Cython is supported. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * Support for HTTP support using "pycurl" and the associated
   URL schemes "http+pycurl://" and "https+pycurl://" has been dropped.
   (Jelmer Vernooij, #82086, #377389, #122258, #516222, #545776, #1696602)

 * Support for medusa for FTP tests has been dropped, only
   pyftpdlib is now supported. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * The deprecated ``brz get`` and ``brz clone`` commands have been
   removed. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * The setting to ignore missing C extensions has been changed from
   ``ignore_missing_extensions=True`` to
   ``suppress_warnings=missing_extensions``. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * Remove format names as options to ``brz init`` and ``brz
   init-repository``.. Now you must use ``brz init --format=...``.
   This simplifies ``brz init --help``.
   (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #330494)

 * ``python-gpg`` is now used for checking GPG signatures rather than
   ``python-gpgme``. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1702308)

 * ``python-gpg`` is now used for signing commits, rather than shelling
   out to the gnupg command. The ``gpg_signing_command`` option has been
   removed.  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #847388)

  Cherry-picked from lp:~vila/bzr/1089352-sni-support
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #1089352)

* The ``bisect`` command now works in non-``.bzr`` directories.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* When creating ``authentication.conf``, umask is now set so only the
  current user can read the file. Breezy warns if the file is
  accessible for other users when it starts.
  (Joke de Buhr, Jelmer Vernooĳ, #475501)

* Support ``brz commit -x`` in combination with iter_changes.

Internals
*********

.. Major internal changes, unlikely to be visible to users or plugin 
   developers, but interesting for brz developers.

Testing
*******

 * A test isolation issue in ``breezy.tests.test_ui`` was fixed,
   which caused ``output_encoding = iso-8859-1`` to be added to the
   users' bazaar.conf. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * Newer versions of ``pyftpdlib`` are now supported for running FTP tests.
