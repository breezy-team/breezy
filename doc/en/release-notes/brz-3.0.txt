brz 3.0.0
#########

:Codename: Pelican
:3.0.0: NOT RELEASED YET

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

 * The bzr command has been renamed to brz, to prevent clashes with upstream
   Bazaar.
   (Martin Packman, Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * The --prefix/-p argument for ``brz diff`` now defaults to -p1 rather
   than -p0. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1695126)

 * The ``brz register-branch`` command from the Launchpad plugin has been
   removed, because it has not worked for at least five years: it relies on
   password authentication rather than SSO, the relevant systems no longer
   have firewall-level access to the outside world, and in general the
   Mirrored branch type is deprecated.  Either just push the branch to
   Launchpad or use code imports instead
   (https://help.launchpad.net/VcsImports).
   (Colin Watson, #254567, #483689)

 * brz no longer supports building the C extensions using Pyrex.
   Only Cython is supported. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * Support for HTTP support using "pycurl" and the associated
   URL schemes "http+pycurl://" and "https+pycurl://" has been dropped.
   (Jelmer Vernooij, #82086, #377389, #122258, #516222, #545776, #1696602)

 * Support for medusa for FTP tests has been dropped, only
   pyftpdlib is now supported. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * The deprecated ``brz get`` and ``brz clone`` commands have been
   removed. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * The setting to ignore missing C extensions has been changed from
   ``ignore_missing_extensions=True`` to
   ``suppress_warnings=missing_extensions``. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * Remove format names as options to ``brz init`` and ``brz
   init-repository``.. Now you must use ``brz init --format=...``.
   This simplifies ``brz init --help``.
   (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #330494)

 * ``python-gpg`` is now used for checking GPG signatures rather than
   ``python-gpgme``. (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #1702308)

 * ``python-gpg`` is now used for signing commits, rather than shelling
   out to the gnupg command. The ``gpg_signing_command`` option has been
   removed.  (Jelmer Vernooĳ, #847388)

 * The ``bzr.transform.orphan_policy`` configuration option
   has been renamed to ``transform.orphan_policy``.
   (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * Backslash (\) is no longer accepted as a path separator
   on platforms where it is not the default path separator,
   e.g. POSIX systems. This is so that filenames with backslashes
   in their name can be added explicitly. (#176263, #165151)

 * One-letter shortcuts for Ubuntu releases are no
   longer supported after 'ubuntu:'. Bazaar's mapping for
   one-letter distroseries had not been updated since natty.
   (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

 * The ``brz lp-mirror-branch`` subcommand has been removed.
   Please use the ``lp-force-branch-mirror`` command from
   the lptools package instead. (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

* The ``bisect`` command now works in non-``.bzr`` directories.
  (Jelmer Vernooĳ)

  on platforms that support it. (Jelmer Vernooij, #81844)

  backslashes in where backslash is not the path separator.

Testing
*******

 * Allow /dev/null to be a symlink to a chardev. (Igo Pashev, #832257)
