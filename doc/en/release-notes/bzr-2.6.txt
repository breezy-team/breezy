bzr 2.6.0
#########

:Codename: Surprise
:2.6.0: 2013-07-27

This release marks the start of a new long-term-stable series. From here, we
will only make bugfix releases on the 2.6 series (2.6.1, etc), while 2.7
will become our new development series.

This is a bugfix and polish release over the 2.5 series, with a large number
of bugs fixed (~50 for the 2.6 series alone).

All known fixed bugs are included here.

Users are encouraged to upgrade from the other stable series.

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

* ``bzr lp-propose --approve`` now also adds an "Approve" vote to the merge
  proposal.  (Jonathan Lange)

New Features
************

* ``bzr switch --store`` now stores uncommitted changes in the branch, and
  restores them when switching back to the branch. (Aaron Bentley)

* New option '--context' for 'bzr diff' command, to configure the amount of 
  context (i.e. showing lines that have not changed).  Also available as the 
  named parameter 'context_lines' to bzrlib.diff.internal_diff(). (Paul Nixon)

* The 'grep' plugin is now shipped with bzr. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* The 'ping' plugin is now shipped with bzr. (Jelmer Vernooij)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr help env-variables`` now points users at ``bzr help configuration``
  which has much more detailed information on the same stuff.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``bzr lp-find-proposal`` now only cares about the revision-id that is
  specified, not the branch you use.  This was enabled by a new API call in
  Launchpad's web service.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Implement authentication.conf password obfuscation, the password_encoding
  option can now be set to base64. (Florian Dorn)

* Local configurations files (i.e. accessed on the local file system like
  ``bazaar.conf`` and ``locations.conf``) are now shared, reducing the
  number of IOs when querying a configuation option. (Vincent Ladeuil,
  #832042)

* ``bzr lp-propose --approve`` now correctly specifies the approved revision
  and provides an "Approve" vote from the proposer, allowing for smoother
  interaction with downstream merge tools.  (Jonathan Lange)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Add a ``progress_bar`` configuration option defaulting to
  ``BZR_PROGRESS_BAR``. This can be set in ``bazaar.conf`` or specified from
  the command line with ``-Oprogress_bar=text``. (Vincent Ladeuil, #388275)

* ``Authentication.Config`` now always returns unicode user names and passwords.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #514301)

* Fixed a bug where the entire contents of ``/etc/mailname`` is read in.
  We only want to read in the first line so that comments could be added
  and would be ignored.
  (Haw Loeung, #932515)

* Fixed a syntax error in ``doc/ja/user-guide/http_smart_server.txt`` that
  causes breakage with docutils 0.9.1.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, Jelmer Vernooij, #1066307)

* Support utf8 characters in platform names even without looking inside the
  box (Fedora's Schr√∂dinger's Cat).  
  (Toshio Kuratomi, Vincent Ladeuil, #1195783)

* Warn when ``--show-base`` is used for ``pull`` in a treeless branch
  instead of failing. It's useless but harmless. (Vincent Ladeuil, #1022160)

* When a missing referenced chk root error is encountered, bzr now suggests
  running ``bzr reconcile --canonicalize-chks``. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* When pushing a specific revision, create the new working tree at
  that revision. (#484516, Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

Documentation
*************

* Clarify ``bzr config`` usages especially around other option references
  expansion. (Vincent Ladeuil, #996401)

API Changes
***********

* None.

Internals
*********

* Add __iter__ to http ResponseFile. (Jelmer Vernooij, #1184021)

* The launchpad plugin now requires API 1.6.0 or later.  This version shipped
  with Ubuntu 9.10.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Better align with upstream gzip.py in tuned_gzip.py. We may lose a bit of
  performance but that's for knit and weave formats and already partly
  deprecated, better keep compatibility than failing fast ;)
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #1116079)

Testing
*******

* Fix test failures occurring only with LC_ALL=C, when prompting a user,
  ``stderr`` encoding should be preferred over terminal encoding if
  available. (Vincent Ladeuil, #1086209)
