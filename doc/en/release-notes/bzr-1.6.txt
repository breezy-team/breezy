bzr 1.6.1
#########

:Released: 2008-09-05

A couple regressions were found in the 1.6 release. There was a
performance issue when using ``bzr+ssh`` to branch large repositories,
and some problems with stacking and ``rich-root`` capable repositories.


bzr 1.6.1rc2
############

:Released: 2008-09-03

Bug Fixes
*********

* Copying between ``rich-root`` and ``rich-root-pack`` (and vice
  versa) was accidentally using the inter-model fetcher, instead of
  recognizing that both were 'rich root' formats.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #264321)


bzr 1.6.1rc1
############

:Released: 2008-08-29

This release fixes a few regressions found in the 1.6 client. Fetching
changes was using an O(N^2) buffering algorithm, so for large projects it
would cause memory thrashing. There is also a specific problem with the
``--1.6-rich-root`` format, which prevented stacking on top of
``--rich-root-pack`` repositories, and could allow users to accidentally
fetch experimental data (``-subtree``) without representing it properly.
The ``--1.6-rich-root`` format has been deprecated and users are
recommended to upgrade to ``--1.6.1-rich-root`` immediately.  Also we
re-introduced a workaround for users who have repositories with incorrect
nodes (not possible if you only used official releases).
I should also clarify that none of this is data loss level issues, but
still sufficient enough to warrant an updated release.

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``RemoteTransport.readv()`` was being inefficient about how it
  buffered the readv data and processed it. It would keep appending to
  the same string (causing many copies) and then pop bytes out of the
  start of the string (causing more copies).
  With this patch "bzr+ssh://local" can improve dramatically,
  especially for projects with large files.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Revision texts were always meant to be stored as fulltexts. There
  was a bug in a bzr.dev version that would accidentally create deltas
  when copying from a Pack repo to a Knit repo. This has been fixed,
  but to support those repositories, we know always request full texts
  for Revision texts. (John Arbash Meinel, #261339)

* The previous ``--1.6-rich-root`` format used an incorrect XML
  serializer, which would accidentally support fetching from a
  repository that supported subtrees, even though the local one would
  not. We deprecated that format, and introduced a new one that uses
  the correct serializer ``--1.6.1-rich-root``.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #262333)


bzr 1.6
#######

:Released: 2008-08-25

Finally, the long awaited bzr 1.6 has been released. This release includes
new features like Stacked Branches, improved weave merge, and an updated
server protocol (now on v3) which will allow for better cross version
compatibility. With this release we have deprecated Knit format
repositories, and recommend that users upgrade them, we will continue to
support reading and writing them for the forseeable future, but we will
not be tuning them for performance as pack repositories have proven to be
better at scaling. This will also be the first release to bundle
TortoiseBzr in the standalone Windows installer.


bzr 1.6rc5
##########

:Released: 2008-08-19

Bug Fixes
*********

* Disable automatic detection of stacking based on a containing
  directory of the target. It interacted badly with push, and needs a
  bit more work to get the edges polished before it should happen
  automatically. (John Arbash Meinel, #259275)
  (This change was reverted when merged to bzr.dev)


bzr 1.6rc4
##########

:Released: 2008-08-18

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix a regression in knit => pack fetching.  We had a logic
  inversion, causing the fetch to insert fulltexts in random order,
  rather than preserving deltas.  (John Arbash Meinel, #256757)


bzr 1.6rc3
##########

:Released: 2008-08-14

Changes
*******

* Disable reading ``.bzrrules`` as a per-branch rule preferences
  file. The feature was not quite ready for a full release.
  (Robert Collins)

Improvements
************

* Update the windows installer to bundle TortoiseBzr and ``qbzr``
  into the standalone installer. This will be the first official
  windows release that installs Tortoise by default.
  (Mark Hammond)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix a regression in ``bzr+http`` support. There was a missing
  function (``_read_line``) that needed to be carried over from
  ``bzr+ssh`` support. (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``GraphIndex`` objects will internally read an entire index if more
  than 1/20th of their keyspace is requested in a single operation.
  This largely mitigates a performance regression in ``bzr log FILE``
  and completely corrects the performance regression in ``bzr log``.
  The regression was caused by removing an accomodation which had been
  supporting the index format in use. A newer index format is in
  development which is substantially faster. (Robert Collins)


bzr 1.6rc2
##########

:Released: 2008-08-13

This release candidate has a few minor bug fixes, and some regression
fixes for Windows.

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr upgrade`` on remote branches accessed via bzr:// and
  bzr+ssh:// now works.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Change the ``get_format_description()`` strings for
  ``RepositoryFormatKnitPack5`` et al to be single line messages.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Fix for a regression on Win32 where we would try to call
  ``os.listdir()`` on a file and not catch the exception properly.
  (Windows raises a different exception.) This would manifest in
  places like ``bzr rm file`` or ``bzr switch``.
  (Mark Hammond, John Arbash Meinel)

* ``Inventory.copy()`` was failing to set the revision property for
  the root entry. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* SFTP transport: added missing ``FileExists`` case to
  ``_translate_io_exception`` (Christophe Troestler, #123475)

* The help for ``bzr ignored`` now suggests ``bzr ls --ignored`` for
  scripting use. (Robert Collins, #3834)

* The default ``annotate`` logic will now always assign the
  last-modified value of a line to one of the revisions that modified
  it, rather than a merge revision. This would happen when both sides
  claimed to have modified the line resulting in the same text. The
  choice is arbitrary but stable, so merges in different directions
  will get the same results.  (John Arbash Meinel, #232188)


bzr 1.6rc1
##########

:Released: 2008-08-06

This release candidate for bzr 1.6 solidifies the new branch stacking
feature.  Bazaar now recommends that users upgrade all knit repositories,
because later formats are much faster.  However, we plan to continue read/write and
upgrade support for knit repostories for the forseeable future.  Several
other bugs and performance issues were fixed.

Changes
*******

* Knit format repositories are deprecated and bzr will now emit
  warnings whenever it encounters one.  Use ``bzr upgrade`` to upgrade
  knit repositories to pack format.  (Andrew Bennetts)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr check`` can now be told which elements at a location it should
  check.  (Daniel Watkins)

* Commit now supports ``--exclude`` (or ``-x``) to exclude some files
  from the commit. (Robert Collins, #3117)

* Fetching data between repositories that have the same model but no
  optimised fetcher will not reserialise all the revisions, increasing
  performance. (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)

* Give a more specific error when target branch is not reachable.
  (James Westby)

* Implemented a custom ``walkdirs_utf8`` implementation for win32.
  This uses a pyrex extension to get direct access to the
  ``FindFirstFileW`` style apis, rather than using ``listdir`` +
  ``lstat``. Shows a very strong improvement in commands like
  ``status`` and ``diff`` which have to iterate the working tree.
  Anywhere from 2x-6x faster depending on the size of the tree (bigger
  trees, bigger benefit.) (John Arbash Meinel)

* New registry for log properties handles  and the method in
  LongLogFormatter to display the custom properties returned by the
  registered handlers. (Guillermo Gonzalez, #162469)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Add more tests that stacking does not create deltas spanning
  physical repository boundaries.
  (Martin Pool, #252428)

* Better message about incompatible repositories.
  (Martin Pool, #206258)

* ``bzr branch --stacked`` ensures the destination branch format can
  support stacking, even if the origin does not.
  (Martin Pool)

* ``bzr export`` no longer exports ``.bzrrules``.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzr serve --directory=/`` now correctly allows the whole
  filesystem to be accessed on Windows, not just the root of the drive
  that Python is running from.
  (Adrian Wilkins, #240910)

* Deleting directories by hand before running ``bzr rm`` will not
  cause subsequent errors in ``bzr st`` and ``bzr commit``.
  (Robert Collins, #150438)

* Fix a test case that was failing if encoding wasn't UTF-8.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #247585)

* Fix "no buffer space available" error when branching with the new
  smart server protocol to or from Windows.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #246180)

* Fixed problem in branching from smart server.
  (#249256, Michael Hudson, Martin Pool)

* Handle a file turning in to a directory in TreeTransform.
  (James Westby, #248448)

API Changes
***********

* ``MutableTree.commit`` has an extra optional keywork parameter
  ``exclude`` that will be unconditionally supplied by the command
  line UI - plugins that add tree formats may need an update.
  (Robert Collins)

* The API minimum version for plugin compatibility has been raised to
  1.6 - there are significant changes throughout the code base.
  (Robert Collins)

* The generic fetch code now uses three attributes on Repository objects
  to control fetch. The streams requested are controlled via :
  ``_fetch_order`` and ``_fetch_uses_deltas``. Setting these
  appropriately allows different repository implementations to recieve
  data in their optimial form. If the ``_fetch_reconcile`` is set then
  a reconcile operation is triggered at the end of the fetch.
  (Robert Collins)

* The ``put_on_disk`` and ``get_tar_item`` methods in
  ``InventoryEntry`` were deprecated. (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``Repository.is_shared`` doesn't take a read lock. It didn't
  need one in the first place (nobody cached the value, and
  ``RemoteRepository`` wasn't taking one either). This saves a round
  trip when probing Pack repositories, as they read the ``pack-names``
  file when locked. And during probe, locking the repo isn't very
  useful. (John Arbash Meinel)

Internals
*********

* ``bzrlib.branchbuilder.BranchBuilder`` is now much more capable of
  putting together a real history without having to create a full
  WorkingTree. It is recommended that tests that are not directly
  testing the WorkingTree use BranchBuilder instead.  See
  ``BranchBuilder.build_snapshot`` or
  ``TestCaseWithMemoryTree.make_branch_builder``.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzrlib.builtins.internal_tree_files`` broken into two giving a new
  helper ``safe_relpath_files`` - used by the new ``exclude``
  parameter to commit. (Robert Collins)

* Make it easier to introduce new WorkingTree formats.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* The code for exporting trees was refactored not to use the
  deprecated ``InventoryEntry`` methods. (Ian Clatworthy)

* RuleSearchers return () instead of [] now when there are no matches.
  (Ian Clatworthy)


bzr 1.6beta3
############

:Released: 2008-07-17

This release adds a new 'stacked branches' feature allowing branches to
share storage without being in the same repository or on the same machine.
(See the user guide for more details.)  It also adds a new hook, improved
weaves, aliases for related locations, faster bzr+ssh push, and several
bug fixes.

Features
********

* New ``pre_change_branch_tip`` hook that is called before the
  branch tip is moved, while the branch is write-locked.  See the User
  Reference for signature details.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Rule-based preferences can now be defined for selected files in
  selected branches, allowing commands and plugins to provide
  custom behaviour for files matching defined patterns.
  See ``Rule-based preferences`` (part of ``Configuring Bazaar``)
  in the User Guide and ``bzr help rules`` for more information.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Sites may suggest a branch to stack new branches on.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Stacked branches are now supported. See ``bzr help branch`` and
  ``bzr help push``.  Branches must be in the ``development1`` format
  to stack, though the stacked-on branch can be of any format.
  (Robert Collins)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr export --format=tgz --root=NAME -`` to export a gzipped tarball
  to stdout; also ``tar`` and ``tbz2``.
  (Martin Pool)

* ``bzr (re)merge --weave`` will now use a standard Weave algorithm,
  rather than the annotation-based merge it was using. It does so by
  building up a Weave of the important texts, without needing to build
  the full ancestry. (John Arbash Meinel, #238895)

* ``bzr send`` documents and better supports ``emacsclient`` (proper
  escaping of mail headers and handling of the MUA Mew).
  (Christophe Troestler)

* Remembered locations can be specified by aliases, e.g. :parent, :public,
  :submit.  (Aaron Bentley)

* The smart protocol now has improved support for setting branches'
  revision info directly.  This makes operations like push
  faster.  The new request method name is
  ``Branch.set_last_revision_ex``.  (Andrew Bennetts)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Bazaar is now able to be a client to the web server of IIS 6 and 7.
  The broken implementations of RFC822 in Python and RFC2046 in IIS
  combined with boundary-line checking in Bazaar previously made this
  impossible. (NB, IIS 5 does not suffer from this problem).
  (Adrian Wilkins, #247585)

* ``bzr log --long`` with a ghost in your mainline now handles that
  ghost properly. (John Arbash Meinel, #243536)

* ``check`` handles the split-up .bzr layout correctly, so no longer
  requires a branch to be present.
  (Daniel Watkins, #64783)

* Clearer message about how to set the PYTHONPATH if bzrlib can't be
  loaded.
  (Martin Pool, #205230)

* Errors about missing libraries are now shown without a traceback,
  and with a suggestion to install the library.  The full traceback is
  still in ``.bzr.log`` and can be shown with ``-Derror``.
  (Martin Pool, #240161)

* Fetch from a stacked branch copies all required data.
  (Aaron Bentley, #248506)

* Handle URLs such as ftp://user@host.com@www.host.com where the user
  name contains an @.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #228058)

* ``needs_read_lock`` and ``needs_write_lock`` now suppress an error during
  ``unlock`` if there was an error in the original function. This helps
  most when there is a failure with a smart server action, since often the
  connection closes and we cannot unlock.
  (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel, #125784)

* Obsolete hidden command ``bzr fetch`` removed.
  (Martin Pool, #172870)

* Raise the correct exception when doing ``-rbefore:0`` or ``-c0``.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #239933)

* You can now compare file revisions in Windows diff programs from
  Cygwin Bazaar.
  (Matt McClure, #209281)

* revision_history now tolerates mainline ghosts for Branch format 6.
  (Aaron Bentley, #235055)

* Set locale from environment for third party libs.
  (Martin von Gagern, #128496)

Documentation
*************

* Added *Using stacked branches* to the User Guide.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Updated developer documentation.
  (Martin Pool)

Testing
*******

* ``-Dmemory`` will cause /proc/PID/status to be catted before bzr
  exits, allowing low-key analysis of peak memory use. (Robert Collins)

* ``TestCaseWithTransport.make_branch_and_tree`` tries harder to return
  a tree with a ``branch`` attribute of the right format.  This was
  preventing some ``RemoteBranch`` tests from actually running with
  ``RemoteBranch`` instances.  (Andrew Bennetts)

API Changes
***********

* Removed ``Repository.text_store``, ``control_store``, etc.  Instead,
  there are new attributes ``texts, inventories, revisions,
  signatures``, each of which is a ``VersionedFiles``.  See the
  Repository docstring for more details.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``Branch.pull`` now accepts an ``_override_hook_target`` optional
  parameter.  If you have a subclass of ``Branch`` that overrides
  ``pull`` then you should add this parameter.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``bzrlib.check.check()`` has been deprecated in favour of the more
  aptly-named ``bzrlib.check.check_branch()``.
  (Daniel Watkins)

* ``Tree.print_file`` and ``Repository.print_file`` are deprecated.
  These methods are bad APIs because they write directly to sys.stdout.
  bzrlib does not use them internally, and there are no direct tests
  for them. (Alexander Belchenko)

Internals
*********

* ``cat`` command no longer uses ``Tree.print_file()`` internally.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

* New class method ``BzrDir.open_containing_tree_branch_or_repository``
  which eases the discovery of the tree, the branch and the repository
  containing a given location.
  (Daniel Watkins)

* New ``versionedfile.KeyMapper`` interface to abstract out the access to
  underlying .knit/.kndx etc files in repositories with partitioned
  storage. (Robert Collins)

* Obsolete developer-use command ``weave-join`` has been removed.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``RemoteToOtherFetcher`` and ``get_data_stream_for_search`` removed,
  to support new ``VersionedFiles`` layering.
  (Robert Collins)


bzr 1.6beta2
############

:Released: 2008-06-10

This release contains further progress towards our 1.6 goals of shallow
repositories, and contains a fix for some user-affecting bugs in the
repository layer.  Building working trees during checkout and branch is
now faster.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Avoid KnitCorrupt error extracting inventories from some repositories.
  (The data is not corrupt; an internal check is detecting a problem
  reading from the repository.)
  (Martin Pool, Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins, #234748)

* ``bzr status`` was breaking if you merged the same revision twice.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

* Fix infinite loop consuming 100% CPU when a connection is lost while
  reading a response body via the smart protocol v1 or v2.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Inserting a bundle which changes the contents of a file with no trailing
  end of line, causing a knit snapshot in a 'knits' repository will no longer
  cause KnitCorrupt. (Robert Collins)

* ``RemoteBranch.pull`` needs to return the ``self._real_branch``'s
  pull result. It was instead just returning None, which breaks ``bzr
  pull``. (John Arbash Meinel, #238149)

* Sanitize branch nick before using it as an attachment filename in
  ``bzr send``. (Lukáš Lalinský, #210218)

* Squash ``inv_entry.symlink_target`` to a plain string when
  generating DirState details. This prevents from getting a
  ``UnicodeError`` when you have symlinks and non-ascii filenames.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #135320)

Improvements
************

* Added the 'alias' command to set/unset and display aliases. (Tim Penhey)

* ``added``, ``modified``, and ``unknowns`` behaviour made consistent (all three
  now quote paths where required). Added ``--null`` option to ``added`` and
  ``modified`` (for null-separated unknowns, use ``ls --unknown --null``)
  (Adrian Wilkins)

* Faster branching (1.09x) and lightweight checkouts (1.06x) on large trees.
  (Ian Clatworthy, Aaron Bentley)

Documentation
*************

* Added *Bazaar Zen* section to the User Guide. (Ian Clatworthy)

Testing
*******

* Fix the test HTTPServer to be isolated from chdir calls made while it is
  running, allowing it to be used in blackbox tests. (Robert Collins)

API Changes
***********

* ``WorkingTree.set_parent_(ids/trees)`` will now filter out revisions
  which are in the ancestry of other revisions. So if you merge the same
  tree twice, or merge an ancestor of an existing merge, it will only
  record the newest. (If you merge a descendent, it will replace its
  ancestor). (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

* ``RepositoryPolicy.__init__`` now requires stack_on and stack_on_pwd,
  through the derived classes do not.  (Aaron Bentley)

Internals
*********

* ``bzrlib.bzrdir.BzrDir.sprout`` now accepts ``stacked`` to control
  creating stacked branches. (Robert Collins)

* Knit record serialisation is now stricter on what it will accept, to
  guard against potential internal bugs, or broken input. (Robert Collins)

bzr 1.6beta1
############

:Released: 2008-06-02

Commands that work on the revision history such as push, pull, missing,
uncommit and log are now substantially faster.  This release adds a
translation of some of the user documentation into Spanish.  (Contributions of
other translations would be very welcome.)  Bazaar 1.6beta1 adds a new network
protocol which is used by default and which allows for more efficient transfers
and future extensions.


Notes When Upgrading
********************

* There is a new version of the network protocol used for bzr://, bzr+ssh://
  and bzr+http:// connections.  This will allow more efficient requests and
  responses, and more graceful fallback when a server is too old to
  recognise a request from a more recent client.  Bazaar 1.6 will
  interoperate with 0.16 and later versions, but servers should be upgraded
  when possible.  Bazaar 1.6 no longer interoperates with 0.15 and earlier via
  these protocols.  Use alternatives like SFTP or upgrade those servers.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #83935)

Changes
*******

* Deprecation warnings will not be suppressed when running ``bzr selftest``
  so that developers can see if their code is using deprecated functions.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

Features
********

* Adding ``-Derror`` will now display a traceback when a plugin fails to
  load. (James Westby)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr branch/push/pull -r XXX`` now have a helper function for finding
  the revno of the new revision (``Graph.find_distance_to_null``). This
  should make something like ``bzr branch -r -100`` in a shared, no-trees
  repository much snappier. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr log --short -r X..Y`` no longer needs to access the full revision
  history. This makes it noticeably faster when logging the last few
  revisions. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr ls`` now accepts ``-V`` as an alias for ``--versioned``.
  (Jerad Cramp, #165086)

* ``bzr missing`` uses the new ``Graph.find_unique_ancestors`` and
  ``Graph.find_differences`` to determine missing revisions without having
  to search the whole ancestry. (John Arbash Meinel, #174625)

* ``bzr uncommit`` now uses partial history access, rather than always
  extracting the full revision history for a branch. This makes it
  resolve the appropriate revisions much faster (in testing it drops
  uncommit from 1.5s => 0.4s). It also means ``bzr log --short`` is one
  step closer to not using full revision history.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #172649)

Bugfixes
********

* ``bzr merge --lca`` should handle when two revisions have no common
  ancestor other than NULL_REVISION. (John Arbash Meinel, #235715)

* ``bzr status`` was breaking if you merged the same revision twice.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

* ``bzr push`` with both ``--overwrite`` and ``-r NNN`` options no longer
  fails.  (Andrew Bennetts, #234229)

* Correctly track the base URL of a smart medium when using bzr+http://
  URLs, which was causing spurious "No repository present" errors with
  branches in shared repositories accessed over bzr+http.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #230550)

* Define ``_remote_is_at_least_1_2`` on ``SmartClientMedium`` so that all
  implementations have the attribute.  Fixes 'PyCurlTransport' object has no
  attribute '_remote_is_at_least_1_2' attribute errors.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #220806)

* Failure to delete an obsolete pack file should just give a warning
  message, not a fatal error.  It may for example fail if the file is still
  in use by another process.
  (Martin Pool)

* Fix MemoryError during large fetches over HTTP by limiting the amount of
  data we try to read per ``recv`` call.  The problem was observed with
  Windows and a proxy, but might affect other environments as well.
  (Eric Holmberg, #215426)

* Handle old merge directives correctly in Merger.from_mergeable.  Stricter
  get_parent_map requirements exposed a latent bug here.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Issue a warning and ignore passwords declared in authentication.conf when
  used for an SSH scheme (sftp:// or bzr+ssh://).
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #203186)

* Make both HTTP implementations raise appropriate exceptions on 403
  Forbidden when POSTing smart requests.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #230223)

* Properly *title* header names in HTTP requests instead of capitalizing
  them.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #229076)

* The "Unable to obtain lock" error message now also suggests using
  ``bzr break-lock`` to fix it.  (Martin Albisetti, #139202)

* Treat an encoding of '' as ascii; this can happen when bzr is run
  under vim on Mac OS X.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

* ``VersionedFile.make_mpdiffs()`` was raising an exception that wasn't in
  scope. (Daniel Fischer #235687)

Documentation
*************

* Added directory structure and started translation of docs in spanish.
  (Martin Albisetti, Lucio Albenga)

* Incorporate feedback from Jelmer Vernooij and Neil Martinsen-Burrell
  on the plugin and integration chapters of the User Guide.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* More Bazaar developer documentation about packaging and release process,
  and about use of Python reprs.
  (Martin Pool, Martin Albisetti)

* Updated Tortise strategy document. (Mark Hammond)

Testing
*******

* ``bzrlib.tests.adapt_tests`` was broken and unused - it has been fixed.
  (Robert Collins)

* Fix the test HTTPServer to be isolated from chdir calls made while it is
  running, allowing it to be used in blackbox tests. (Robert Collins)

* New helper function for splitting test suites
  ``split_suite_by_condition``. (Robert Collins)

Internals
*********

* ``Branch.missing_revisions`` has been deprecated. Similar functionality
  can be obtained using ``bzrlib.missing.find_unmerged``. The api was
  fairly broken, and the function was unused, so we are getting rid of it.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

API Changes
***********

* ``Branch.abspath`` is deprecated; use the Tree or Transport
  instead.  (Martin Pool)

* ``Branch.update_revisions`` now takes an optional ``Graph``
  object. This can be used by ``update_revisions`` when it is
  checking ancestry, and allows callers to prefer request to go to a
  local branch.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Branch, Repository, Tree and BzrDir should expose a Transport as an
  attribute if they have one, rather than having it indirectly accessible
  as ``.control_files._transport``.  This doesn't add a requirement
  to support a Transport in cases where it was not needed before;
  it just simplifies the way it is reached.  (Martin Pool)

* ``bzr missing --mine-only`` will return status code 0 if you have no
  new revisions, but the remote does. Similarly for ``--theirs-only``.
  The new code only checks one side, so it doesn't know if the other
  side has changes. This seems more accurate with the request anyway.
  It also changes the output to print '[This|Other] branch is up to
  date.' rather than displaying nothing.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``LockableFiles.put_utf8``, ``put_bytes`` and ``controlfilename``
  are now deprecated in favor of using Transport operations.
  (Martin Pool)

* Many methods on ``VersionedFile``, ``Repository`` and in
  ``bzrlib.revision``  deprecated before bzrlib 1.5 have been removed.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``RevisionSpec.wants_revision_history`` can be set to False for a given
  ``RevisionSpec``. This will disable the existing behavior of passing in
  the full revision history to ``self._match_on``. Useful for specs that
  don't actually need access to the full history. (John Arbash Meinel)

* The constructors of ``SmartClientMedium`` and its subclasses now require a
  ``base`` parameter.  ``SmartClientMedium`` implementations now also need
  to provide a ``remote_path_from_transport`` method.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* The default permissions for creating new files and directories
  should now be obtained from ``BzrDir._get_file_mode()`` and
  ``_get_dir_mode()``, rather than from LockableFiles.  The ``_set_file_mode``
  and ``_set_dir_mode`` variables on LockableFiles which were advertised
  as a way for plugins to control this are no longer consulted.

* ``VersionedFile.join`` is deprecated. This method required local
  instances of both versioned file objects and was thus hostile to being
  used for streaming from a smart server. The new get_record_stream and
  insert_record_stream are meant to efficiently replace this method.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``WorkingTree.set_parent_(ids/trees)`` will now filter out revisions
  which are in the ancestry of other revisions. So if you merge the same
  tree twice, or merge an ancestor of an existing merge, it will only
  record the newest. (If you merge a descendent, it will replace its
  ancestor). (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

* ``WorkingTreeFormat2.stub_initialize_remote`` is now private.
