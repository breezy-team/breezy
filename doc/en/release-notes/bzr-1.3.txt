bzr 1.3.1rc1
############

:Released: 2008-04-04

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix a bug causing a ValueError crash in ``parse_line_delta_iter`` when
  fetching revisions from a knit to pack repository or vice versa using
  bzr:// (including over HTTP or SSH).
  (#208418, Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool, Robert Collins)


bzr 1.3
#######

:Released: 2008-03-20

Bazaar has become part of the GNU project <http://www.gnu.org>

Many operations that act on history, including ``log`` and ``annotate`` are now
substantially faster.  Several bugs have been fixed and several new options and
features have been added.

Testing
*******

* Avoid spurious failure of ``TestVersion.test_version`` matching
  directory names.
  (#202778, Martin Pool)


bzr 1.3rc1
##########

:Released: 2008-03-16

Notes When Upgrading
********************

* The backup directory created by ``upgrade`` is now called
  ``backup.bzr``, not ``.bzr.backup``. (Martin Albisetti)

Changes
*******

* A new repository format 'development' has been added. This format will
  represent the latest 'in-progress' format that the bzr developers are
  interested in getting early-adopter testing and feedback on.
  ``doc/developers/development-repo.txt`` has detailed information.
  (Robert Collins)

* BZR_LOG environment variable controls location of .bzr.log trace file.
  User can suppress writing messages to .bzr.log by using '/dev/null'
  filename (on Unix) or 'NUL' (on Windows). If BZR_LOG variable
  is not defined but BZR_HOME is defined then default location
  for .bzr.log trace file is ``$BZR_HOME/.bzr.log``.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #106117)

* ``launchpad`` builtin plugin now shipped as separate part in standalone
  bzr.exe, installed to ``C:\Program Files\Bazaar\plugins`` directory,
  and standalone installer allows user to skip installation of this plugin.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

* Restore auto-detection of plink.exe on Windows. (Dmitry Vasiliev)

* Version number is now shown as "1.2" or "1.2pr2", without zeroed or
  missing final fields.  (Martin Pool)

Features
********

* ``branch`` and ``checkout`` can hard-link working tree files, which is
  faster and saves space.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr send`` will now also look at the ``child_submit_to`` setting in
  the submit branch to determine the email address to send to.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

Improvements
************

* BzrBranch._lefthand_history is faster on pack repos.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Branch6.generate_revision_history is faster.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Directory services can now be registered, allowing special URLs to be
  dereferenced into real URLs.  This is a generalization and cleanup of
  the lp: transport lookup.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Merge directives that are automatically attached to emails have nicer
  filenames, based on branch-nick + revno. (Aaron Bentley)

* ``push`` has a ``--revision`` option, to specify what revision to push up
  to.  (Daniel Watkins)

* Significantly reducing execution time and network traffic for trivial
  case of running ``bzr missing`` command for two identical branches.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

* Speed up operations that look at the revision graph (such as 'bzr log').
  ``KnitPackRepositor.get_revision_graph`` uses ``Graph.iter_ancestry`` to
  extract the revision history. This allows filtering ghosts while
  stepping instead of needing to peek ahead. (John Arbash Meinel)

* The ``hooks`` command lists installed hooks, to assist in debugging.
  (Daniel Watkins)

* Updates to how ``annotate`` work. Should see a measurable improvement in
  performance and memory consumption for file with a lot of merges.
  Also, correctly handle when a line is introduced by both parents (it
  should be attributed to the first merge which notices this, and not
  to all subsequent merges.) (John Arbash Meinel)

Bugfixes
********

* Autopacking no longer holds the full set of inventory lines in
  memory while copying. For large repositories, this can amount to
  hundreds of MB of ram consumption.
  (Ian Clatworthy, John Arbash Meinel)

* Cherrypicking when using ``--format=merge3`` now explicitly excludes
  BASE lines. (John Arbash Meinel, #151731)

* Disable plink's interactive prompt for password.
  (#107593, Dmitry Vasiliev)

* Encode command line arguments from unicode to user_encoding before
  invoking external mail client in `bzr send` command.
  (#139318, Alexander Belchenko)

* Fixed problem connecting to ``bzr+https://`` servers.
  (#198793, John Ferlito)

* Improved error reporting in the Launchpad plugin. (Daniel Watkins,
  #196618)

* Include quick-start-summary.svg file to python-based installer(s)
  for Windows. (#192924, Alexander Belchenko)

* lca merge now respects specified files. (Aaron Bentley)

* Make version-info --custom imply --all. (#195560, James Westby)

* ``merge --preview`` now works for merges that add or modify
  symlinks (James Henstridge)

* Redirecting the output from ``bzr merge`` (when the remembered
  location is used) now works. (John Arbash Meinel)

* setup.py script explicitly checks for Python version.
  (Jari Aalto, Alexander Belchenko, #200569)

* UnknownFormatErrors no longer refer to branches regardless of kind of
  unknown format. (Daniel Watkins, #173980)

* Upgrade bundled ConfigObj to version 4.5.2, which properly quotes #
  signs, among other small improvements. (Matt Nordhoff, #86838)

* Use correct indices when emitting LCA conflicts.  This fixes IndexError
  errors.  (Aaron Bentley, #196780)

Documentation
*************

* Explained how to use ``version-info --custom`` in the User Guide.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

API Breaks
**********

* Support for loading plugins from zip files and
  ``bzrlib.plugin.load_from_zip()`` function are deprecated.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

Testing
*******

* Added missing blackbox tests for ``modified`` (Adrian Wilkins)

* The branch interface tests were invalid for branches using rich-root
  repositories because the empty string is not a valid file-id.
  (Robert Collins)

Internals
*********

* ``Graph.iter_ancestry`` returns the ancestry of revision ids. Similar to
  ``Repository.get_revision_graph()`` except it includes ghosts and you can
  stop part-way through. (John Arbash Meinel)

* New module ``tools/package_mf.py`` provide custom module finder for
  python packages (improves standard python library's modulefinder.py)
  used by ``setup.py`` script while building standalone bzr.exe.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

* New remote method ``RemoteBzrDir.find_repositoryV2`` adding support for
  detecting external lookup support on remote repositories. This method is
  now attempted first when lookup up repositories, leading to an extra
  round trip on older bzr smart servers. (Robert Collins)

* Repository formats have a new supported-feature attribute
  ``supports_external_lookups`` used to indicate repositories which support
  falling back to other repositories when they have partial data.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``Repository.get_revision_graph_with_ghosts`` and
  ``bzrlib.revision.(common_ancestor,MultipleRevisionSources,common_graph)``
  have been deprecated.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``Tree.iter_changes`` is now a public API, replacing the work-in-progress
  ``Tree._iter_changes``. The api is now considered stable and ready for
  external users.  (Aaron Bentley)

* The bzrdir format registry now accepts an ``alias`` keyword to
  register_metadir, used to indicate that a format name is an alias for
  some other format and thus should not be reported when describing the
  format. (Robert Collins)
