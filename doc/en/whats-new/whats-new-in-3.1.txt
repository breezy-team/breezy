What's New in Breezy 3.1?
*************************

This is the second release series for Breezy since it was forked from Bazaar.
From here on, we will primarily make bugfix releases on the 3.1 series (3.1.1,
etc) while 3.2 will become our new development series.

This document accumulates a high level summary of what's changed.  See the
:doc:`../release-notes/index` for a full list.

Users are encouraged to upgrade from the other stable series.  This document
outlines the improvements in Breezy 3.1 vs Breezy 3.0. As well as
summarizing improvements made to the core product, it highlights
enhancements within the broader Breezy world of potential interest to those
upgrading.

Breezy 3.1.0 is fully compatible both locally and on the network with Bazaar
2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 as well as Breezy 3.0, and can read
and write repositories generated by all previous versions.


Python 2 EOL'ed
***************

The 3.1 series will be the last Breezy release series that supports Python 2.7.
Release series 3.2 and later will only support Python 3.5 and later.

New command names
*****************

``brz init-repo`` has been renamed to ``brz init-shared-repo``
to emphasize that it creates
shared repositories rather than just any kind of repository.

``brz sprout`` is now an alias for ``brz branch``.

New Commands
************

A new ``brz land`` command can merge merge proposals
on Launchpad, GitHub or GitLab instances.

The ``brz patch`` command (previously bundled in bzrtools) can apply
patches to a tree.

The ``brz clone`` command can clone an entire local or remote control
directory, rather than just a single branch (as the ``brz branch`` command does).

Better detection of other version control systems
*************************************************

Breezy can now detect local Subversion, Fossil and Mercurial
repositories and notify the user about conversion
options.

It will also detect and inform about remote Mercurial, Fossil, CVS-Pserver and
Subversion repositories.

Nested Tree Support
*******************

This release improves support for by-reference nested trees in Breezy, both
in the Bazaar and Git formats.

Note that nested tree support is not complete yet, and commands for creating
nested trees are still hidden.

Improved Git support
********************

This release contains a large number of fixes for the Git support
in Breezy, both for crash fixes and performance.

There is also improved support for honoring more of the
standard Git configuration variables in e.g. ~/.gitconfig.

Repositories with Git submodules can now be imported into
Bazaar branches.
