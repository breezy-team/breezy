Installing Breezy
=================

GNU/Linux

Breezy packages are available for most popular GNU/Linux distributions
including Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat and Gentoo.
See https://www.breezy-vcs.org/pages/download.html for the latest instructions.

Windows
-------

https://bugs.launchpad.net/brz/+bug/1951124 for details.

Other operating systems
-----------------------

Beyond Linux, Breezy packages are available for a large
range of other operating systems include Mac OS X, FreeBSD and Solaris.
See https://www.breezy-vcs.org/pages/download.html for the latest instructions.


Installing from scratch
-----------------------

If you wish to install Breezy from scratch rather than using a
pre-built package, the steps are:

  1. If it is not installed already, install Python 2.7 or later.

  2. Download the ``breezy-xxx.tar.gz`` file (where xxx is the version
     number) from https://www.breezy-vcs.org/pages/download.html or from Launchpad
     (https://launchpad.net/~brz/).

  3. Unpack the archive using tar, WinZip or equivalent.

  4. Put the created directory on your PATH.

To test the installation, try running the **brz** command like this::

  brz version

This will display the version of Breezy you have installed. If this
doesn't work, please contact us via email or IRC so we can help you
get things working.


Installing into site-wide locations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of adding the directory to your PATH, you can install brz into the
system locations using::

  python setup.py install

If you do not have a compiler, or do not have the python development tools
installed, brz supplies a (slower) pure-python implementation of all
extensions. You can install without compiling extensions with::

  python setup.py install build_ext --allow-python-fallback



Running the development version
-------------------------------

You may wish to always be using the very latest development version of
Breezy. Note that this is not recommended for
the majority of users as there is an increased risk of bugs. On the other
hand, the development version is remarkably solid (thanks to the processes
we follow) and running it makes it easier for you to send us changes for
bugs and improvements. It also helps us by having more people testing
the latest software.

Here are the steps to follow:

  1. Install Breezy using one of the methods given above.

  2. Get a copy of the development version like this::

       brz branch lp:brz

  3. Put the created directory on your PATH.

Advanced users may also wish to build the optional C extensions for greater
speed. This can be done using ``make`` and requires ``cython`` and a C compiler.
Please contact us on email or IRC if you need assistance with this.


Running multiple versions
-------------------------

It's easy to have multiple versions of Breezy installed and to switch
between them. To do this,
simply provide the full pathname to the **brz** command you wish to run.
The relevant libraries will be automatically detected and used. Of course,
if you do not provide a pathname, then the **brz** used will be the one
found on your system path as normal.

Note that this capability is particularly useful if you wish to run
(or test) both the latest released version and the development version say.
