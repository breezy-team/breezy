Running a smart server
======================

Breezy does not require a specialised server because it operates over HTTP, FTP
or SFTP.  There is an optional smart server that can be invoked over SSH, from
inetd, or in a dedicated mode.

Dumb servers
------------

We describe HTTP, FTP, SFTP and HTTP-WebDAV as "dumb" servers because they do
not offer any assistance to Breezy.  If you make a Breezy repository available
over any of these protocols, Breezy will allow you to read it remotely.  Just
enter the URL to the branch in the Breezy command you are running.::

    brz log http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~brz-pqm/brz/brz.dev

Breezy supports writing over FTP, SFTP and (via a plugin) over HTTP-WebDAV.

High-performance smart server
-----------------------------

The high-performance smart server (hpss) performs certain operations much faster
than dumb servers are capable of.  In future releases, the range of operations
that are improved by using the smart server will increase as we continue to
tune performance.

To maintain the highest security possible, the current
smart server provides read-only access by default.  To
enable read-write access, run it with ``--allow-writes``. When using
the SSH access method, brz automatically runs with the
``--allow-writes`` option.

The alternative ways of configuring a smart server are explained below.

SSH
~~~

Using Breezy over SSH requires no special configuration on the server; so long
as Breezy is installed on the server you can use ``bzr+ssh`` URLs, e.g.::

    brz log bzr+ssh://host/path/to/branch

If `brz` is not installed system-wide on the server you may need to explicitly
tell the local `brz` where to find the remote `brz`::

    BZR_REMOTE_PATH=~/bin/brz brz log bzr+ssh://host/path/to/branch

The ``BZR_REMOTE_PATH`` environment variable adjusts how `brz` will be
invoked on the remote system.  By default, just `brz` will be invoked,
which requires the `brz` executable to be on the default search path.  You can
also set this permanently per-location in ``locations.conf``.

Like SFTP, paths starting with ``~`` are relative to your home directory, e.g.
``bzr+ssh://example.com/~/code/proj``.  Additionally, paths starting with
``~user`` will be relative to that user's home directory.

inetd
~~~~~

This example shows how to run `brz` with a dedicated user `brzuser`
for a shared repository in ``/srv/brz/repo`` which has a branch at
``/srv/brz/repo/branchname``.

Running a Breezy server from inetd requires an inetd.conf entry::

    4155  stream  TCP  nowait  brzuser  /usr/bin/brz /usr/bin/brz serve --inet --directory=/srv/brz/repo

When running client commands, the URL you supply is a `bzr://` URL relative to
the ``--directory`` option given in inetd.conf::

    brz log bzr://host/branchname

If possible, paths starting with ``~`` and ``~user`` will be expanded as for
``bzr+ssh``.  Home directories outside the ``--directory`` specified to ``brz
serve`` will not be accessible.

Dedicated
~~~~~~~~~

This mode has the same path and URL behaviour as the inetd mode.  To
run as a specific user, you should use ``su`` or login as that user.

This example runs brz on its official port number of `4155` and listens on all
interfaces. This allows connections from anywhere in the world that can reach
your machine on port `4155`.

server::

    brz serve --directory=/srv/brz/repo

client::

    brz log bzr://host/branchname

This example runs ``brz serve`` on `localhost` port `1234`.

server::

    brz serve --listen=localhost --port=1234 --directory=/srv/brz/repo

client::

    brz log bzr://localhost:1234/branchname
