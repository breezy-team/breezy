Annotating changes
==================

Seeing the origin of content
----------------------------

When two or more people are working on files, it can be highly
useful at times to see who created or last changed certain content.
To do this, using the annotate command like this::

  brz annotate readme.txt

If you are a pessimist or an optimist, you might prefer to use
one of built-in aliases for ``annotate``: ``blame`` or ``praise``.
Either way, this displays each line of the file together with
information such as:

 * who changed it last
 * when it was last changed
 * the commit message.

GUI tools
---------

The various GUI plugins for Breezy provide graphical tools for
viewing annotation information. For example, the brz-gtk plugin
provides a GUI tool for this that can be launched using the
``gannotate`` command::

  brz gannotate readme.txt

The GUI tools typically provide a much richer display of
interesting information (e.g. all the changes in each commit)
so you may prefer them over the text-based command.
