Git Limitations
===============

Breezy's support for Git repositories currently has the following limitations:

* No support for creating annotated tags. pad.lv/1758185
* No support for gitattributes and the features that depend on it (lfs, eol, etc). pad.lv/1802797
* Limited support for submodules. pad.lv/402814
* No rename/copy inference. pad.lv/1760740
* No support for creating shallow branches (pad.lv/1760151)
* No good way to refer to git remotes from the command-line (pad.lv/1702283)
* No mailmap support (pad.lv/544031)

Functionality similar to git that's missing:

* No rebase command. pad.lv/1708046
* No --amend option for commit. pad.lv/507529
* No clone/fetch commands. pad.lv/831939
