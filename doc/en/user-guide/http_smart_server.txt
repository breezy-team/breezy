Serving Breezy with Apache
==========================

This document describes one way to set up a Breezy HTTP smart server,
using Apache 2.0 and FastCGI or mod_python or mod_wsgi.

For more information on the smart server, and other ways to configure it
see the main `smart server documentation <server.html>`_.

Example
-------

You have a webserver already publishing `/srv/example.com/www/code` as
`http://example.com/code/...` with plain HTTP.  It contains branches and
directories like `/srv/example.com/www/code/branch-one` and
`/srv/example.com/www/code/my-repo/branch-two`.  You want to provide read-only
smart server access to these directories in addition to the existing HTTP
access.

Configuring Apache 2.0
----------------------

FastCGI
~~~~~~~

First, configure mod_fastcgi, e.g. by adding lines like these to your
httpd.conf::

    LoadModule fastcgi_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_fastcgi.so
    FastCgiIpcDir /var/lib/apache2/fastcgi

In our example, we're already serving `/srv/example.com/www/code` at
`http://example.com/code`, so our existing Apache configuration would look
like::

    Alias /code /srv/example.com/www/code
    <Directory /srv/example.com/www/code>
        Options Indexes
        # ...
    </Directory>

We need to change it to handle all requests for URLs ending in `.brz/smart`.  It
will look like::

    Alias /code /srv/example.com/www/code
    <Directory /srv/example.com/www/code>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteBase /code
        RewriteRule ^(.*/)?\.bzr/smart$ /srv/example.com/scripts/brz-smart.fcgi
    </Directory>

    # brz-smart.fcgi isn't under the DocumentRoot, so Alias it into the URL
    # namespace so it can be executed.
    Alias /srv/example.com/scripts/brz-smart.fcgi /srv/example.com/scripts/brz-smart.fcgi
    <Directory /srv/example.com/scripts>
        Options ExecCGI
        <Files brz-smart.fcgi>
            SetHandler fastcgi-script
        </Files>
    </Directory>

This instructs Apache to hand requests for any URL ending with `/.brz/smart`
inside `/code` to a Breezy smart server via FastCGI.

Refer to the mod_rewrite_ and mod_fastcgi_ documentation for further
information.

.. _mod_rewrite: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html
.. _mod_fastcgi: http://www.fastcgi.com/mod_fastcgi/docs/mod_fastcgi.html

mod_python
~~~~~~~~~~

First, configure mod_python, e.g. by adding lines like these to your
httpd.conf::

    LoadModule python_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_python.so

Define the rewrite rules with mod_rewrite the same way as for FastCGI, except
change::

    RewriteRule ^(.*/)?\.bzr/smart$ /srv/example.com/scripts/brz-smart.fcgi

to::

    RewriteRule ^(.*/)?\.bzr/smart$ /srv/example.com/scripts/brz-smart.py

Like with mod_fastcgi, we also define how our script is to be handled::

    Alias /srv/example.com/scripts/brz-smart.py /srv/example.com/scripts/brz-smart.py
    <Directory /srv/example.com/scripts>
        <Files brz-smart.py>
            PythonPath "sys.path+['/srv/example.com/scripts']"
            AddHandler python-program .py
            PythonHandler brz-smart::handler
        </Files>
    </Directory>

This instructs Apache to hand requests for any URL ending with `/.brz/smart`
inside `/code` to a Breezy smart server via mod_python.

NOTE: If you don't have breezy in your PATH, you will be need to change the
following line::

            PythonPath "sys.path+['/srv/example.com/scripts']"

To::

            PythonPath "['/path/to/brz']+sys.path+['/srv/example.com/scripts']"


Refer to the mod_python_ documentation for further information.

.. _mod_python: http://www.modpython.org/


mod_wsgi
~~~~~~~~

First, configure mod_wsgi, e.g. enabling the mod with a2enmod wsgi.
We need to change it to handle all requests for URLs ending in `.brz/smart`.  It
will look like::

    WSGIScriptAliasMatch ^/code/.*/\.bzr/smart$ /srv/example.com/scripts/brz.wsgi

    #The three next lines allow regular GETs to work too
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/code/.*/\.bzr/smart$
    RewriteRule ^/code/(.*/\.bzr/.*)$ /srv/example.com/www/code/$1 [L]

    <Directory /srv/example.com/www/code>
        WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
    </Directory>

This instructs Apache to hand requests for any URL ending with `/.brz/smart`
inside `/code` to a Breezy smart server via WSGI, and any other URL inside
`/code` to be served directly by Apache.

Refer to the mod_wsgi_ documentation for further information.

.. _mod_wsgi: http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/

Configuring Breezy
------------------

FastCGI
~~~~~~~

We've configured Apache to run the smart server at
`/srv/example.com/scripts/brz-smart.fcgi`.  This is just a simple script we need
to write to configure a smart server, and glue it to the FastCGI gateway.
Here's what it looks like::

    import fcgi
    from breezy.transport.http import wsgi

    smart_server_app = wsgi.make_app(
        root='/srv/example.com/www/code',
        prefix='/code/',
        path_var='REQUEST_URI',
        readonly=True,
        load_plugins=True,
        enable_logging=True)

    fcgi.WSGIServer(smart_server_app).run()

The `fcgi` module can be found at http://svn.saddi.com/py-lib/trunk/fcgi.py.  It
is part of flup_.

mod_python
~~~~~~~~~~

We've configured Apache to run the smart server at
`/srv/example.com/scripts/brz-smart.py`.  This is just a simple script we need
to write to configure a smart server, and glue it to the mod_python gateway.
Here's what it looks like::

    import modpywsgi
    from breezy.transport.http import wsgi

    smart_server_app = wsgi.make_app(
        root='/srv/example.com/www/code',
        prefix='/code/',
        path_var='REQUEST_URI',
        readonly=True,
        load_plugins=True,
        enable_logging=True)

    def handler(request):
        """Handle a single request."""
        wsgi_server = modpywsgi.WSGIServer(smart_server_app)
        return wsgi_server.run(request)

The `modpywsgi` module can be found at
http://ice.usq.edu.au/svn/ice/trunk/apps/ice-server/modpywsgi.py. It was
part of pocoo_. You sould make sure you place modpywsgi.py in the same
directory as brz-smart.py (ie. /srv/example.com/scripts/).

.. _pocoo: http://dev.pocoo.org/projects/pocoo/


mod_wsgi
~~~~~~~~

We've configured Apache to run the smart server at
`/srv/example.com/scripts/brz.wsgi`.  This is just a simple script we need
to write to configure a smart server, and glue it to the WSGI gateway.
Here's what it looks like::

    from breezy.transport.http import wsgi

    def application(environ, start_response):
        app = wsgi.make_app(
            root="/srv/example.com/www/code/",
            prefix="/code",
            readonly=True,
            enable_logging=False)
        return app(environ, start_response)

Clients
-------

Now you can use `brz+http://` URLs or just `http://` URLs, e.g.::

    brz log brz+http://example.com/code/my-branch

Plain HTTP access should continue to work::

    brz log http://example.com/code/my-branch

Advanced configuration
----------------------

Because the Breezy HTTP smart server is a WSGI application, it can be used with
any 3rd-party WSGI middleware or server that conforms the WSGI standard.  The
only requirements are:

  * to construct a `SmartWSGIApp`, you need to specify a **root transport** that it
    will serve.
  * each request's `environ` dict must have a **'breezy.relpath'** variable set.

The `make_app` helper used in the example constructs a `SmartWSGIApp` with a
transport based on the `root` path given to it, and calculates the
'breezy.relpath` for each request based on the `prefix` and `path_var`
arguments.  In the example above, it will take the 'REQUEST_URI' (which is set
by Apache), strip the '/code/' prefix and the '/.brz/smart' suffix, and set that
as the 'breezy.relpath', so that a request for '/code/foo/bar/.brz/smart' will
result in a 'breezy.relpath' of 'foo/brz'.

It's possible to configure a smart server for a non-local transport, or that
does arbitrary path translations, etc, by constructing a `SmartWSGIApp`
directly.  Refer to the docstrings of `breezy.transport.http.wsgi` and the `WSGI
standard`_ for further information.

.. _WSGI standard: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/


Pushing over the HTTP smart server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to allow pushing data over the HTTP smart server. The
easiest way to do this, is to just supply ``readonly=False`` to the
``wsgi.make_app()`` call. But be careful, because the smart protocol does
not contain any Authentication. So if you enable write support, you will
want to restrict access to ``.brz/smart`` URLs to restrict who can
actually write data on your system, e.g. in apache it looks like::

    <Location /code>
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "example"
        AuthUserFile /srv/example.com/conf/auth.passwd
        <LimitExcept GET>
            Require valid-user
        </LimitExcept>
    </Location>

At this time, it is not possible to allow some people to have read-only
access and others to have read-write access to the same URLs. Because at
the HTTP layer (which is doing the Authenticating), everything is just a
POST request.  However, it would certainly be possible to have HTTPS
require authentication and use a writable server, and plain HTTP allow
read-only access.

If brz gives an error like this when accessing your HTTPS site::

  brz: ERROR: Connection error: curl connection error (server certificate verification failed.
  CAfile:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt CRLfile: none)

You can workaround it by using ``https+urllib`` rather than ``http`` in your
URL, or by uninstalling pycurl.  See `bug 82086`_ for more details.
