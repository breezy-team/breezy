bzr 0.90
########

:Released: 2007-08-28

Improvements
************

* Documentation is now organized into multiple directories with a level
  added for different languages or locales. Added the Mini Tutorial
  and Quick Start Summary (en) documents from the Wiki, improving the
  content and readability of the former. Formatted NEWS as Release Notes
  complete with a Table of Conents, one heading per release. Moved the
  Developer Guide into the main document catalog and provided a link
  from the developer document catalog back to the main one.
  (Ian Clatworthy, Sabin Iacob, Alexander Belchenko)


API Changes
***********

* The static convenience method ``BzrDir.create_repository``
  is deprecated.  Callers should instead create a ``BzrDir`` instance
  and call ``create_repository`` on that.  (Martin Pool)


bzr 0.90rc1
###########

:Released: 2007-08-14

Bugfixes
********

* ``bzr init`` should connect to the remote location one time only.  We
  have been connecting several times because we forget to pass around the
  Transport object. This modifies ``BzrDir.create_branch_convenience``,
  so that we can give it the Transport we already have.
  (John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil, #111702)

* Get rid of SFTP connection cache (get rid of the FTP one too).
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #43731)

* bzr branch {local|remote} remote don't try to create a working tree
  anymore.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #112173)

* All identified multiple connections for a single bzr command have been
  fixed. See bzrlib/tests/commands directory.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``bzr rm`` now does not insist on ``--force`` to delete files that
  have been renamed but not otherwise modified.  (Marius Kruger,
  #111664)

* ``bzr selftest --bench`` no longer emits deprecation warnings
  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* ``bzr status`` now honours FILE parameters for conflict lists
  (Aaron Bentley, #127606)

* ``bzr checkout`` now honours -r when reconstituting a working tree.
  It also honours -r 0.  (Aaron Bentley, #127708)

* ``bzr add *`` no more fails on Windows if working tree contains
  non-ascii file names. (Kuno Meyer, #127361)

* allow ``easy_install bzr`` runs without fatal errors.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #125521)

* Graph._filter_candidate_lca does not raise KeyError if a candidate
  is eliminated just before it would normally be examined.  (Aaron Bentley)

* SMTP connection failures produce a nice message, not a traceback.
  (Aaron Bentley)

Improvements
************

* Don't show "dots" progress indicators when run non-interactively, such
  as from cron.  (Martin Pool)

* ``info`` now formats locations more nicely and lists "submit" and
  "public" branches (Aaron Bentley)

* New ``pack`` command that will trigger database compression within
  the repository (Robert Collins)

* Implement ``_KnitIndex._load_data`` in a pyrex extension. The pyrex
  version is approximately 2-3x faster at parsing a ``.kndx`` file.
  Which yields a measurable improvement for commands which have to
  read from the repository, such as a 1s => 0.75s improvement in
  ``bzr diff`` when there are changes to be shown.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Merge is now faster.  Depending on the scenario, it can be more than 2x
  faster. (Aaron Bentley)

* Give a clearer warning, and allow ``python setup.py install`` to
  succeed even if pyrex is not available.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``DirState._read_dirblocks`` now has an optional Pyrex
  implementation. This improves the speed of any command that has to
  read the entire DirState. (``diff``, ``status``, etc, improve by
  about 10%).
  ``bisect_dirblocks`` has also been improved, which helps all
  ``_get_entry`` type calls (whenever we are searching for a
  particular entry in the in-memory DirState).
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr pull`` and ``bzr push`` no longer do a complete walk of the
  branch revision history for ui display unless -v is supplied.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``bzr log -rA..B`` output shifted to the left margin if the log only
  contains merge revisions. (Kent Gibson)

* The ``plugins`` command is now public with improved help.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* New bundle and merge directive formats are faster to generate, and

* Annotate merge now works when there are local changes. (Aaron Bentley)

* Commit now only shows the progress in terms of directories instead of
  entries. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Fix ``KnitRepository.get_revision_graph`` to not request the graph 2
  times. This makes ``get_revision_graph`` 2x faster. (John Arbash
  Meinel)

* Fix ``VersionedFile.get_graph()`` to avoid using
  ``set.difference_update(other)``, which has bad scaling when
  ``other`` is large. This improves ``VF.get_graph([version_id])`` for
  a 12.5k graph from 2.9s down to 200ms. (John Arbash Meinel)

* The ``--lsprof-file`` option now generates output for KCacheGrind if
  the file starts with ``callgrind.out``. This matches the default file
  filtering done by KCacheGrind's Open Dialog. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Fix ``bzr update`` to avoid an unnecessary
  ``branch.get_master_branch`` call, which avoids 1 extra connection
  to the remote server. (Partial fix for #128076, John Arbash Meinel)

* Log errors from the smart server in the trace file, to make debugging
  test failures (and live failures!) easier.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* The HTML version of the man page has been superceded by a more
  comprehensive manual called the Bazaar User Reference. This manual
  is completed generated from the online help topics. As part of this
  change, limited reStructuredText is now explicitly supported in help
  topics and command help with 'unnatural' markup being removed prior
  to display by the online help or inclusion in the man page.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* HTML documentation now use files extension ``*.html``
  (Alexander Belchenko)

* The cache of ignore definitions is now cleared in WorkingTree.unlock()
  so that changes to .bzrignore aren't missed. (#129694, Daniel Watkins)

* ``bzr selftest --strict`` fails if there are any missing features or
  expected test failures. (Daniel Watkins, #111914)

* Link to registration survey added to README. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Windows standalone installer show link to registration survey
  when installation finished. (Alexander Belchenko)

Library API Breaks
******************

* Deprecated dictionary ``bzrlib.option.SHORT_OPTIONS`` removed.
  Options are now required to provide a help string and it must
  comply with the style guide by being one or more sentences with an
  initial capital and final period. (Martin Pool)

* KnitIndex.get_parents now returns tuples. (Robert Collins)

* Ancient unused ``Repository.text_store`` attribute has been removed.
  (Robert Collins)

* The ``bzrlib.pack`` interface has changed to use tuples of bytestrings
  rather than just bytestrings, making it easier to represent multiple
  element names. As this interface was not used by any internal facilities
  since it was introduced in 0.18 no API compatibility is being preserved.
  The serialised form of these packs is identical with 0.18 when a single
  element tuple is in use. (Robert Collins)

Internals
*********

* merge now uses ``iter_changes`` to calculate changes, which makes room for
  future performance increases.  It is also more consistent with other
  operations that perform comparisons, and reduces reliance on
  Tree.inventory.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Refactoring of transport classes connected to a remote server.
  ConnectedTransport is a new class that serves as a basis for all
  transports needing to connect to a remote server.  transport.split_url
  have been deprecated, use the static method on the object instead. URL
  tests have been refactored too.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Better connection sharing for ConnectedTransport objects.
  transport.get_transport() now accepts a 'possible_transports' parameter.
  If a newly requested transport can share a connection with one of the
  list, it will.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Most functions now accept ``bzrlib.revision.NULL_REVISION`` to indicate
  the null revision, and consider using ``None`` for this purpose
  deprecated.  (Aaron Bentley)

* New ``index`` module with abstract index functionality. This will be
  used during the planned changes in the repository layer. Currently the
  index layer provides a graph aware immutable index, a builder for the
  same index type to allow creating them, and finally a composer for
  such indices to allow the use of many indices in a single query. The
  index performance is not optimised, however the API is stable to allow
  development on top of the index. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.dirstate.cmp_by_dirs`` can be used to compare two paths by
  their directory sections. This is equivalent to comparing
  ``path.split('/')``, only without having to split the paths.
  This has a Pyrex implementation available.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* New transport decorator 'unlistable+' which disables the list_dir
  functionality for testing.

* Deprecated ``change_entry`` in transform.py. (Ian Clatworthy)

* RevisionTree.get_weave is now deprecated.  Tree.plan_merge is now used
  for performing annotate-merge.  (Aaron Bentley)

* New EmailMessage class to create email messages. (Adeodato Simó)

* Unused functions on the private interface KnitIndex have been removed.
  (Robert Collins)

* New ``knit.KnitGraphIndex`` which provides a ``KnitIndex`` layered on top
  of a ``index.GraphIndex``. (Robert Collins)

* New ``knit.KnitVersionedFile.iter_parents`` method that allows querying
  the parents of many knit nodes at once, reducing round trips to the
  underlying index. (Robert Collins)

* Graph now has an is_ancestor method, various bits use it.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* The ``-Dhpss`` flag now includes timing information. As well as
  logging when a new connection is opened. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzrlib.pack.ContainerWriter`` now returns an offset, length tuple to
  callers when inserting data, allowing generation of readv style access
  during pack creation, without needing a separate pass across the output
  pack to gather such details. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.pack.make_readv_reader`` allows readv based access to pack
  files that are stored on a transport. (Robert Collins)

* New ``Repository.has_same_location`` method that reports if two
  repository objects refer to the same repository (although with some risk
  of false negatives).  (Andrew Bennetts)

* InterTree.compare now passes require_versioned on correctly.
  (Marius Kruger)

* New methods on Repository - ``start_write_group``,
  ``commit_write_group``, ``abort_write_group`` and ``is_in_write_group`` -
  which provide a clean hook point for transactional Repositories - ones
  where all the data for a fetch or commit needs to be made atomically
  available in one step. This allows the write lock to remain while making
  a series of data insertions.  (e.g. data conversion). (Robert Collins)

* In ``bzrlib.knit`` the internal interface has been altered to use
  3-tuples (index, pos, length) rather than two-tuples (pos, length) to
  describe where data in a knit is, allowing knits to be split into
  many files. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.knit._KnitData`` split into cache management and physical access
  with two access classes - ``_PackAccess`` and ``_KnitAccess`` defined.
  The former provides access into a .pack file, and the latter provides the
  current production repository form of .knit files. (Robert Collins)

Testing
*******

* Remove selftest ``--clean-output``, ``--numbered-dirs`` and
  ``--keep-output`` options, which are obsolete now that tests
  are done within directories in $TMPDIR.  (Martin Pool)

* The SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable is now reset to avoid
  interaction with any running SSH agents.  (Jelmer Vernooij, #125955)

* run_bzr_subprocess handles parameters the same way as run_bzr:
  either a string or a list of strings should be passed as the first
  parameter.  Varargs-style parameters are deprecated. (Aaron Bentley)
