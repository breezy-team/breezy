Pseudo merging
==============

Cherrypicking
-------------

At times, it can be useful to selectively merge some of the changes
in a branch, but not all of them. This is commonly referred to as
*cherrypicking*. Here are some examples of where cherrypicking is
useful:

* selectively taking fixes from the main development branch into
  a release branch

* selectively taking improvements out of an experimental branch into
  a feature branch.

To merge only the changes made by revision X in branch ``foo``,
the command is::

  brz merge -c X foo

To merge only the changes up to revision X in branch ``foo``,
the command is::

  brz merge -r X foo

To merge only the changes since revision X in branch ``foo``,
the command is::

  brz merge -r X.. foo

To merge only the changes from revision X to revision Y in branch ``foo``,
the command is::

  brz merge -r X..Y foo

Like a normal merge, you must explicitly commit a cherrypick. You may wish
to see the changes made using ``brz diff``, and run your test suite if any,
before doing this.

Unlike a normal merge, Breezy does not currently track cherrypicks.
In particular, the changes look like a normal commit and the (internal)
revision history of the changes from the other branch is lost.
In many cases where they are useful (see above), this is not a major
problem because there are good reasons why a full merge should never
be done at a later time. In other cases, additional conflicts will need
to be resolved when the changes are merged again.

Merging without parents
-----------------------

A related technique to cherrypicking, in that it makes changes without
reference to the revisions that they came from is to perform a merge, but
forget about the parent revisions before committing.  This has the effect of
making all of the changes that would have been in the merge happen in a single
commit.  After the merge and before the corresponding commit, you can do::

  brz revert --forget-merges

to keep the changes in the working tree, but remove the record of the
revisions where the changes originated.  The next commit would then record
all of those changes without any record of the merged revisions.

This is desired by some users to make their history "cleaner", but you should
be careful that the loss of history does not outweigh the value of cleanliness,
particularly given Breezy's capabilities for progressively disclosing merged
revisions.  In particular, because this will include the changes from the
source branch, but without attribution to that branch, it can lead to
additional conflicts on later merges that involve the same source and
target branches.


Reverse cherrypicking
---------------------

Cherrypicking can be used to reverse a set of changes made by giving an
upper bound in the revision range which is *below* the lower bound.
For example, to back-out changes made in revision 10, the command is::

  brz merge -r 10..9

If you want to take most changes, but not all, from somewhere else, you
may wish to do a normal merge followed by a few reverse cherrypicks.


Merging uncommitted changes
---------------------------

If you have several branches and you accidentally start making changes in the
wrong one, here are the steps to take to correct this. Assuming you began
working in branch ``foo`` when you meant to work in branch ``bar``:

1. Change into branch ``bar``.
2. Run ``brz merge --uncommitted foo``
3. Check the changes came across (``brz diff``)
4. Change into branch ``foo``
5. Run ``brz revert``.

Rebasing
--------

Another option to normal merging is *rebasing*, i.e. making it look like
the current branch originated from a different point than it did.
Rebasing is supported in Breezy by the ``rebase`` command provided by
the ``rebase`` plugin.

The ``rebase`` command takes the location of another branch on which
the branch in the current working directory will be rebased. If a branch
is not specified then the parent branch is used, and this is usually the
desired result.

The first step identifies the revisions that are in the current branch
that are not in the parent branch. The current branch is then set to be
at the same revision as the target branch, and each revision is replayed
on top of the branch. At the end of the process it will appear as though
your current branch was branched off the current last revision of the target.

Each revision that is replayed may cause conflicts in the tree. If this
happens the command will stop and allow you to fix them up. Resolve the
commits as you would for a ``merge``, and then run ``brz resolve`` to
marked them as resolved. Once you have resolved all the conflicts, you
should run ``brz rebase-continue`` to continue the rebase operation.
If conflicts are encountered and you decide not to continue,
you can run ``brz rebase-abort``. You can also use ``rebase-todo`` to
show the list of commits still to be replayed.

Note: Some users coming from central VCS tools with poor merge tracking
like rebasing because it's similar to how they are use to working in older
tools, or because "perfectly clean" history seems important. Before rebasing
in Breezy, think about whether a normal merge is a better choice. In
particular, rebasing a private branch before sharing it is OK but
rebasing after sharing a branch with someone else is **strongly** discouraged.
