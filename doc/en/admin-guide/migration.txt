Migration
=========

Migrating between version control systems can be a complicated process, and
Bazaar has extensive documentation on the process at 
https://www.breezy-vcs.org/doc/migration/en and we won't attempt to repeat that
here.  We will try to give a few motivating examples for conversion from
Mercurial and Subversion.

Fast Import
-----------

In many projects wishing to use Bazaar, there is pre-existing history for the
codebase that should be taken into consideration.  Bazaar leverages an
interchange format originally developed for Git called `fast-import` to
provide migration strategies for many other version control systems.

The way that fast-import can be used for migration is to export the existing
history into a fast-import file, then use the ``brz fast-import`` command.
The `fastimport` plugin includes exporters for Subversion, CVS, Git, Mercurial
and darcs, accessible as the ``fast-export-from-XXX`` commands.  Note that
``fast-import`` should not be used in a branch with existing history.

Assuming that ProjectX was first developed in Mercurial before switching to
Bazaar, and that the Mercurial repository is in ``/srv/hg/projectx``, the
following commands will import that history into a newly created ``trunk``
branch.  (Recall that in `Further Configuration
<simple-setups.html#further-configuration>`_ we created the
``/srv/bzr/projectx`` directory as a shared repository.)

::

  $ cd /srv/bzr/projectx
  $ brz fast-export-from-hg ../../hg/projectx projectx.fi
  $ brz init trunk
  $ brz fast-import projectx.fi trunk

Subversion Conversion
---------------------

As the most common centralized version control system, migration from
Subversion is particularly important for any *new* version control system.
Bazaar's `svn`_ plugin provides tools for interaction with Subversion
projects.  In fact, Bazaar can be used transparently with projects stored in
Subversion, but that is beyond the scope of this document.  (See
https://www.breezy-vcs.org/doc/migration/en/foreign/bzr-on-svn-projects.html for
more on that subject.)  What is relevant here is the ``svn-import`` command
provided by that plugin.  This can import an entire subversion repository
including tags and branches, particularly if they are stored in Subversion's
recommended directory structure: ``/tags/``, ``/branches/`` and ``/trunk/``.

This command has flexible ways to specify what paths within the Subversion
repository contain branches and which contain tags.  For example, the
recommended layout for Subversion projects (called ``trunk`` by the svn
plugin) could be specified in ``~/.config/breezy/subversion.conf`` as

::

  [203ae883-c723-44c9-aabd-cb56e4f81c9a]
  branches = branches/*
  tags = tags/*

This allows substantially complicated Subversion repositories to be converted
into a set of separate Bazaar branches.  After installing the svn plugin, see
``brz help svn-import`` and ``brz help svn-layout``.
