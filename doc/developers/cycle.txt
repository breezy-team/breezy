The Bazaar Development Cycle
============================



General process
---------------

We normally have one person acting as the release manager, who 
organizes development for the release and also actually makes the release
tarball and posts announcements.  It can be a different person from one
release to the next.

Our usual process is that one week before release we will make a release
branch from the trunk.  We do one commit to that branch to change the
version number to 'rc1', and advance the trunk version to 'dev' for the
next release.

We then publish and announce this release candidate according to the
process below.  We then have a week of general testing of the rc,
including some time for plugin authors to update their code for any
changes.

Normally no changes will be made on the release branch unless serious bugs
or regressions are found, and the release manager decides they should be
merged in.  After one week, the release branch's version number is updated
and it's published as the final release.  If regressions or serious
problems are discovered after the final release we may make an additional
point release from that branch.

The process or timing can vary if that seems appropriate in a particular
case but we try to release on a regular four week cycle.

The net effect is that the code gets some extra testing before release,
and the trunk is always open for general development.


Starting a Release
------------------

To start a new release cycle:

#. Send mail to the list with the key dates, who will be the release
   manager, and the main themes or targetted bugs.  Ask people to nominate
   objectives, or point out any high-risk things that are best done early,
   or that interact with other changes.

#. Add a new "series" in Launchpad at <https://launchpad.net/bzr/+addseries>.  
   There is one series for every *x.y* release.

#. Add milestones to that series for the release candidate and the final
   release, and their expected dates.

#. Deactivate old releases and their milestones.

#. Update the version number in the ``bzr`` script, and the
   ``bzrlib/__init__.py`` file.


Weekly Metronome Mail
---------------------

Every week the release manager should send a mail to the Bazaar list
covering these points (as appropriate):

* Early communication about changing dependencies or defaults

* Reminder re lifecycle and where we're up to right now, in particular the 
  dates for the next release and/or candidate.

* Summary of recent successes and pending work.

* Reminder re release objectives

* Reminder re things needing attention, e.g. bug triage, reviews, testing
  of certain things, etc.


Starting the release phase
--------------------------

When it's time to make the release candidate:

#. We create a new pqm-controlled branch for this release series.  The
   branch must be created by Robert Collins on the pqm server.  
   This branch means that from the first release candidate onwards,
   general development continues on the trunk, and only
   specifically-targetted fixes go into the release.

#. Register the branch at <https://launchpad.net/products/bzr/+addbranch>

#. The revision at the start of that branch is `released
   <releasing.html>`_ as the first RC.
