*Bazaar-NG* (``bzr``) is a project of `Canonical Ltd`__ to develop an
open source distributed version control system that is powerful,
friendly, and scalable.  The project is at an early stage of
development.

User documentation
------------------

* `Project overview/introduction <intro.html>`__

* `Command reference <cmdref.html>`__ -- intended to be user
  documentation, and gives the best overview at the moment of what the
  system will feel like to use.  Fairly complete.


Requirements and general design
-------------------------------

* `Various purposes of a VCS <purpose.html>`__ -- taking snapshots and
  helping with merges is not the whole story.

* `Requirements <requirements.html>`__

* `Costs <costs.html>`__ of various factors: time, disk, network, etc.

* `Deadly sins <deadly-sins.html>`__ that gcc maintainers suggest we avoid.

* `Overview of the whole design <design.html>`__ and miscellaneous
  small design points.

* `File formats <formats.html>`__

* `Random observations <random.html>`__ that don't fit anywhere else yet.



Design of particular features
-----------------------------

* `Automatic generation of ChangeLogs <changelogs.html>`__

* `Cherry picking <cherry-picking.html>`__ -- merge just selected non-contiguous changes  from a branch.

* `Common changeset format <common-format.html>`__ for  interchange
  format between VCS.

* `Compression <compression.html>`__ of file text for more efficient storage.

* `Config specs <config-specs.html>`__ assemble a tree from several places.

* `Conflicts <conflicts.html>`_ that can occur during merge-like
  operations.

* `Ignored files <ignore.html>`__

* `Recovering from interrupted operations <interrupted.html>`__

* `Inventory command <inventory.html>`__

* `Branch joins <join-branches.html>`__ represent that all the changes
  from one branch are integrated into another.

* `Kill a version <kill-version.html>`__ to fix a broken commit or
  wrong message, or to
  remove confidential information from the history.

* `Hash collisions <hashes.html>`__ and weaknesses, and the security
  implications thereof.

* `Layers <layers.html>`__ within the design

* `Library interface <library-interface.html>`__ for Python.

* `Merge <merge.html>`__

* `Mirroring <mirroring.html>`__

* `Optional edit command <optional-edit.html>`__: sometimes people
  want to make the  working copy read-only, or not present at all.

* `Partial commits <partial-commit.html>`__

* `Patch pools <pool.html>`__ to efficiently store related branches.

* `Revfiles <revfile.html>`__ store the text history of files.

* `Revfiles storing annotations <revfile-annotation.txt>`__

* `Revision syntax <revision-syntax.html>`__ -- ``hello.c@12``, etc.

* `Roll-up commits <rollup.html>`__ -- a single revision incorporates
  the changes from several others.

* `Scalability <scalability.html>`__

* `Security <security.html>`__

* `Shared branches <shared-branches.html>`__ maintained by more than
  one person

* `Supportability <supportability.html>`__ -- how to handle any bugs
  or problems in the field.

* `Place tags on revisions for easy reference <tagging.html>`__

* `Detecting unchanged files <unchanged.html>`__
   
* `Merging previously-unrelated branches <unrelated-merge.html>`__

* `Usability principles <usability.html>`__ (very small at the moment)

* `<use-cases.html>`__

* `<web-interface.html>`__

* `<workflow.html>`__ Modelling/controlling flow of patches.

* `<yaml.html>`__ --  Discussion of using YAML_ as a storage or transmission format.

.. _YAML: http://www.yaml.org/



Comparisons to other systems
----------------------------

* `Taxonomy <taxonomy.html>`__: basic questions a VCS must answer.

* `Bitkeeper <bitkeeper.html>`__, the proprietary system used by some
  kernel developers.

* `Aegis <compared-aegis.html>`__, a tool focussed on enforcing
  process and workflow.

* `Codeville <compared-codeville.html>`__ has an intruiging but
  scarcely-documented merge algorithm.

* `CVSNT <compared-cvsnt.html>`__, with more Windows support and some
  merge enhancements.

* `OpenCM <compared-opencm.html>`__, another hash-based tool with a
  good whitepaper.

* `PRCS <compared-prcs.html>`__, a non-distributed inventory-based tool.

* `GNU Arch <todo-from-arch.html>`__, with many pros and cons.

* `Darcs <darcs.html>`__, a merge-focussed tool with good usability.

* `Quilt <quilt.html>`__ -- Andrew Morton's patch scripts, popular with kernel maintainers.

* `Monotone <monotone.html>`__, Graydon Hoare's hash-based distributed system.

* `SVK <svk.html>`__ --     distributed operation stacked on Subversion.

* `Sun Teamware <compared-teamware.html>`__


Project management and organization
-----------------------------------

* `Notes on how to get a VCS adopted <adoption.html>`__

* `Thanks <thanks.html>`__ to various people

* `Extra commands <extra-commands.html>`__ for
  internal/developer/debugger use.

* `Choice of Python as a development language <python.html>`__
