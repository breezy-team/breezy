Special character handling in URLs
==================================

Internally bzr treats paths to branches as URLs. For convenience, it
generally allows users to specify locations as regular paths, and then
will determine the appropriate URL representation. There are a few
characters which have special meaning in URLs and need careful handling to
avoid ambiguities.

If a string is supplied which appears to be a valid fully qualified URL,
then bzr will not try to escape any characters. For example, if you have a
directory named '/tmp/%2False' these are all valid ways of accessing the
content::
  cd /tmp
  bzr log /tmp/%2False
  bzr log %2False
  bzr log file:///tmp/%2EFalse

These are not valid::
  bzr log file:///tmp/%2False (refers to a file called /tmp/False)
  bzr log %2EFalse (refers to a file called /tmp/%2EFalse)

Comma also has special meaning in URLs, because it denotes `segment parameters`_
