# A utility that executes a script from our %PYTHON%\Scripts directory.
# Example usage:
# 'python run_script.py cog.py arg1 arg2'
# which will locate %PYTHON_HOME%/Scripts/cog.py and execute it with the args.
# This is only necessary for Windows, and only when the build process is
# executed via a cygwin/*nix based make utility, which doesn't honor the
# PATHEXT environment variable.
