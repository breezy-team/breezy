    node identifiers can be any hashable object, and are typically strings.

    This function has the same purpose as the TopoSorter class, but uses a
    different algorithm to sort the graph. That means that while both return a
    list with parents before their child nodes, the exact ordering can be
    different.

    topo_sort is faster when the whole list is needed, while when iterating
    over a part of the list, TopoSorter.iter_topo_order should be used.
