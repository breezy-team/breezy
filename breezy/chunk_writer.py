"""ChunkWriter: write compressed data out with a fixed upper bound."""

import zlib
from zlib import Z_FINISH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH


class ChunkWriter(object):
    """ChunkWriter allows writing of compressed data with a fixed size.

    If less data is supplied than fills a chunk, the chunk is padded with
    NULL bytes. If more data is supplied, then the writer packs as much
    in as it can, but never splits any item it was given.

    The algorithm for packing is open to improvement! Current it is:
     - write the bytes given
     - if the total seen bytes so far exceeds the chunk size, flush.

    :cvar _max_repack: To fit the maximum number of entries into a node, we
        will sometimes start over and compress the whole list to get tighter
        packing. We get diminishing returns after a while, so this limits the
        number of times we will try.
        The default is to try to avoid recompressing entirely, but setting this
        to something like 20 will give maximum compression.

    :cvar _max_zsync: Another tunable nob. If _max_repack is set to 0, then you
        can limit the number of times we will try to pack more data into a
        node. This allows us to do a single compression pass, rather than
        trying until we overflow, and then recompressing again.
