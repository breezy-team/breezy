# The newly committed revision is going to have a shape corresponding
# to that of the working tree.  Files that are not in the
# working tree and that were in the predecessor are reported as
# removed --- this can include files that were either removed from the
# inventory or deleted in the working tree.  If they were only
# deleted from disk, they are removed from the working inventory.

# We then consider the remaining entries, which will be in the new
# version.  Directory entries are simply copied across.  File entries
# must be checked to see if a new version of the file should be
# recorded.  For each parent revision tree, we check to see what
# version of the file was present.  If the file was present in at
# least one tree, and if it was the same version in all the trees,
# then we can just refer to that version.  Otherwise, a new version
# representing the merger of the file versions must be added.

# TODO: Update hashcache before and after - or does the WorkingTree
# look after that?

# TODO: Rather than mashing together the ancestry and storing it back,
# perhaps the weave should have single method which does it all in one
# go, avoiding a lot of redundant work.

# TODO: Perhaps give a warning if one of the revisions marked as
# merged is already in the ancestry, and then don't record it as a
# distinct parent.

# TODO: If the file is newly merged but unchanged from the version it
# merges from, then it should still be reported as newly added
# relative to the basis revision.

# TODO: Change the parameter 'rev_id' to 'revision_id' to be consistent with
# the rest of the code; add a deprecation of the old name.
