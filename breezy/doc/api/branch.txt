The Branch API in breezy provides creation and management of Branches.

A Branch represents a series of commits and merges carried out by a user.

Make a temporary directory for these tests:

   >>> import tempfile
   >>> test_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix='breezy_doc_api_branch_txt_')

Branches are created by ControlDir's:

   >>> from breezy.branch import Branch
   >>> from breezy.controldir import ControlDir

   >>> new_branch = ControlDir.create_branch_convenience(test_dir)

Existing Branches can be opened directly:

   >>> transport = new_branch.controldir.transport
   >>> another_instance = Branch.open(transport.clone('..').base)

or via the ControlDir:

   >>> still_the_same_branch = new_branch.controldir.open_branch()

A branch has a history of revisions on it:

   >>> new_branch.last_revision()
   b'null:'

We need to write some more documentation, showing
push and pull operations. Cloning might also be nice.

And finally, clean up:

   >>> import shutil
   >>> shutil.rmtree(test_dir)
