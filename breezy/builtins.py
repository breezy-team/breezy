    removed
        Versioned in the previous revision but removed or deleted
        in the working copy.

    renamed
        Path of this file changed from the previous revision;
        the text may also have changed.  This includes files whose
        parent directory was renamed.

    modified
        Text has changed since the previous revision.

    kind changed
        File kind has been changed (e.g. from file to directory).

    unknown
        Not versioned and not matching an ignore pattern.

    Additionally for directories, symlinks and files with a changed
    executable bit, Breezy indicates their type using a trailing
    character: '/', '@' or '*' respectively. These decorations can be
    disabled using the '--no-classify' option.

    To see ignored files use 'brz ignored'.  For details on the
    changes to file texts, use 'brz diff'.

    Note that --short or -S gives status flags for each item, similar
    to Subversion's status command. To get output similar to svn -q,
    use brz status -SV.

    If no arguments are specified, the status of the entire working
    directory is shown.  Otherwise, only the status of the specified
    files or directories is reported.  If a directory is given, status
    is reported for everything inside that directory.

    Before merges are committed, the pending merge tip revisions are
    shown. To see all pending merge revisions, use the -v option.
    To skip the display of pending merge information altogether, use
    the no-pending option or specify a file/directory.

    To compare the working directory to a specific revision, pass a
    single revision to the revision argument.

    To see which files have changed in a specific revision, or between
    two revisions, pass a revision range to the revision argument.

    In non-recursive mode, all the named items are added, regardless
    of whether they were previously ignored.  A warning is given if
    any of the named files are already versioned.

    In recursive mode (the default), files are treated the same way
    but the behaviour for directories is different.  Directories that
    are already versioned do not give a warning.  All directories,
    whether already versioned or not, are searched for files or
    subdirectories that are neither versioned or ignored, and these
    are added.  This search proceeds recursively into versioned
    directories.  If no names are given '.' is assumed.

    A warning will be printed when nested trees are encountered,
    unless they are explicitly ignored.

    Therefore simply saying 'brz add' will version all files that
    are currently unknown.

    Adding a file whose parent directory is not versioned will
    implicitly add the parent, and so on up to the root. This means
    you should never need to explicitly add a directory, they'll just
    get added when you add a file in the directory.

    --dry-run will show which files would be added, but not actually
    add them.

    --file-ids-from will try to use the file ids from the supplied path.
    It looks up ids trying to find a matching parent directory with the
    same filename, and then by pure path. This option is rarely needed
    but can be useful when adding the same logical file into two
    branches that will be merged later (without showing the two different
    adds as a conflict). It is also useful when merging another project
    into a subdirectory of this one.

    Any files matching patterns in the ignore list will not be added
    unless they are explicitly mentioned.

    In recursive mode, files larger than the configuration option
    add.maximum_file_size will be skipped. Named items are never skipped due
    to file size.

    By default, this command only works on branches that have not diverged.
    Branches are considered diverged if the destination branch's most recent
    commit is one that has not been merged (directly or indirectly) into the
    parent.

    If branches have diverged, you can use 'brz merge' to integrate the changes
    from one into the other.  Once one branch has merged, the other should
    be able to pull it again.

    If you want to replace your local changes and just want your branch to
    match the remote one, use pull --overwrite. This will work even if the two
    branches have diverged.

    If there is no default location set, the first pull will set it (use
    --no-remember to avoid setting it). After that, you can omit the
    location to use the default.  To change the default, use --remember. The
    value will only be saved if the remote location can be accessed.

    The --verbose option will display the revisions pulled using the log_format
    configuration option. You can use a different format by overriding it with
    -Olog_format=<other_format>.

    Note: The location can be specified either in the form of a branch,
    or in the form of a path to a file containing a merge directive generated

    You can use this to visit an older revision, or to update a working tree
    that is out of date from its branch.

    If there are any uncommitted changes in the tree, they will be carried
    across and remain as uncommitted changes after the update.  To discard
    these changes, use 'brz revert'.  The uncommitted changes may conflict
    with the changes brought in by the change in basis revision.

    If the tree's branch is bound to a master branch, brz will also update
    the branch from the master.

    You cannot update just a single file or directory, because each Breezy
    working tree has just a single basis revision.  If you want to restore a
    file that has been removed locally, use 'brz revert' instead of 'brz
    update'.  If you want to restore a file to its state in a previous
    revision, use 'brz revert' with a '-r' option, or use 'brz cat' to write
    out the old content of that file to a new location.

    The 'dir' argument, if given, must be the location of the root of a

    New branches created under the repository directory will store their
    revisions in the repository, not in the branch directory.  For branches
    with shared history, this reduces the amount of storage needed and
    speeds up the creation of new branches.

    If the --no-trees option is given then the branches in the repository
    will not have working trees by default.  They will still exist as
    directories on disk, but they will not have separate copies of the
    files at a certain revision.  This can be useful for repositories that
    store branches which are interacted with through checkouts or remote
    branches, such as on a server.

        Create a shared repository holding just branches::

            brz init-shared-repo --no-trees repo

class cmd_log(Command):

    log is brz's default tool for exploring the history of a branch.
    The branch to use is taken from the first parameter. If no parameters
    are given, the branch containing the working directory is logged.
    Here are some simple examples::

      brz log                       log the current branch
      brz log foo.py                log a file in its branch
      brz log http://server/branch  log a branch on a server

    The filtering, ordering and information shown for each revision can
    be controlled as explained below. By default, all revisions are
    shown sorted (topologically) so that newer revisions appear before
    older ones and descendants always appear before ancestors. If displayed,
    merged revisions are shown indented under the revision in which they
    were merged.

    :Output control:

      The log format controls how information about each revision is
      displayed. The standard log formats are called ``long``, ``short``
      and ``line``. The default is long. See ``brz help log-formats``
      for more details on log formats.

      The following options can be used to control what information is
      displayed::

        -l N        display a maximum of N revisions
        -n N        display N levels of revisions (0 for all, 1 for collapsed)
        -v          display a status summary (delta) for each revision
        -p          display a diff (patch) for each revision
        --show-ids  display revision-ids (and file-ids), not just revnos

      Note that the default number of levels to display is a function of the
      log format. If the -n option is not used, the standard log formats show
      just the top level (mainline).

      Status summaries are shown using status flags like A, M, etc. To see
      the changes explained using words like ``added`` and ``modified``
      instead, use the -vv option.

    :Ordering control:

      To display revisions from oldest to newest, use the --forward option.
      In most cases, using this option will have little impact on the total
      time taken to produce a log, though --forward does not incrementally
      display revisions like --reverse does when it can.

    :Revision filtering:

      The -r option can be used to specify what revision or range of revisions
      to filter against. The various forms are shown below::

        -rX      display revision X
        -rX..    display revision X and later
        -r..Y    display up to and including revision Y
        -rX..Y   display from X to Y inclusive

      See ``brz help revisionspec`` for details on how to specify X and Y.
      Some common examples are given below::

        -r-1                show just the tip
        -r-10..             show the last 10 mainline revisions
        -rsubmit:..         show what's new on this branch
        -rancestor:path..   show changes since the common ancestor of this
                            branch and the one at location path
        -rdate:yesterday..  show changes since yesterday

      When logging a range of revisions using -rX..Y, log starts at
      revision Y and searches back in history through the primary
      ("left-hand") parents until it finds X. When logging just the
      top level (using -n1), an error is reported if X is not found
      along the way. If multi-level logging is used (-n0), X may be
      a nested merge revision and the log will be truncated accordingly.

    :Path filtering:

      If parameters are given and the first one is not a branch, the log
      will be filtered to show only those revisions that changed the
      nominated files or directories.

      Filenames are interpreted within their historical context. To log a
      deleted file, specify a revision range so that the file existed at
      the end or start of the range.

      Historical context is also important when interpreting pathnames of
      renamed files/directories. Consider the following example:

      * revision 1: add tutorial.txt
      * revision 2: modify tutorial.txt
      * revision 3: rename tutorial.txt to guide.txt; add tutorial.txt

      In this case:

      * ``brz log guide.txt`` will log the file added in revision 1

      * ``brz log tutorial.txt`` will log the new file added in revision 3

      * ``brz log -r2 -p tutorial.txt`` will show the changes made to
        the original file in revision 2.

      * ``brz log -r2 -p guide.txt`` will display an error message as there
        was no file called guide.txt in revision 2.

      Renames are always followed by log. By design, there is no need to
      explicitly ask for this (and no way to stop logging a file back
      until it was last renamed).

    :Other filtering:

      The --match option can be used for finding revisions that match a
      regular expression in a commit message, committer, author or bug.
      Specifying the option several times will match any of the supplied
      expressions. --match-author, --match-bugs, --match-committer and
      --match-message can be used to only match a specific field.

    :Tips & tricks:

      GUI tools and IDEs are often better at exploring history than command
      line tools: you may prefer qlog or viz from qbzr or bzr-gtk, the
      bzr-explorer shell, or the Loggerhead web interface.  See the Bazaar
      Plugin Guide <http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/plugins/en/> and
      <http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/IDEIntegration>.

      You may find it useful to add the aliases below to ``breezy.conf``::

        [ALIASES]
        tip = log -r-1
        top = log -l10 --line
        show = log -v -p

      ``brz tip`` will then show the latest revision while ``brz top``
      will show the last 10 mainline revisions. To see the details of a
      particular revision X,  ``brz show -rX``.

      If you are interested in looking deeper into a particular merge X,
      use ``brz log -n0 -rX``.

      ``brz log -v`` on a branch with lots of history is currently
      very slow. A fix for this issue is currently under development.
      With or without that fix, it is recommended that a revision range
      be given when using the -v option.

      brz has a generic full-text matching plugin, brz-search, that can be
      used to find revisions matching user names, commit messages, etc.
      Among other features, this plugin can find all revisions containing
      a list of words but not others.

      When exploring non-mainline history on large projects with deep
      history, the performance of log can be greatly improved by installing
      the historycache plugin. This plugin buffers historical information
      trading disk space for faster speed.

class cmd_ignore(Command):
    __doc__ = """Ignore specified files or patterns.

    See ``brz help patterns`` for details on the syntax of patterns.

    If a .bzrignore file does not exist, the ignore command
    will create one and add the specified files or patterns to the newly
    created file. The ignore command will also automatically add the
    .bzrignore file to be versioned. Creating a .bzrignore file without
    the use of the ignore command will require an explicit add command.

    To remove patterns from the ignore list, edit the .bzrignore file.
    After adding, editing or deleting that file either indirectly by
    using this command or directly by using an editor, be sure to commit
    it.

    Breezy also supports a global ignore file ~/.config/breezy/ignore. On
    Windows the global ignore file can be found in the application data
    directory as
    C:\\Documents and Settings\\<user>\\Application Data\\Breezy\\3.0\\ignore.
    Global ignores are not touched by this command. The global ignore file
    can be edited directly using an editor.

    Patterns prefixed with '!' are exceptions to ignore patterns and take
    precedence over regular ignores.  Such exceptions are used to specify
    files that should be versioned which would otherwise be ignored.

    Patterns prefixed with '!!' act as regular ignore patterns, but have
    precedence over the '!' exception patterns.

    :Notes:

    * Ignore patterns containing shell wildcards must be quoted from
      the shell on Unix.

    * Ignore patterns starting with "#" act as comments in the ignore file.
      To ignore patterns that begin with that character, use the "RE:" prefix.

    :Examples:
        Ignore the top level Makefile::

            brz ignore ./Makefile

        Ignore .class files in all directories...::

            brz ignore "*.class"

        ...but do not ignore "special.class"::

            brz ignore "!special.class"

        Ignore files whose name begins with the "#" character::

            brz ignore "RE:^#"

        Ignore .o files under the lib directory::

            brz ignore "lib/**/*.o"

        Ignore .o files under the lib directory::

            brz ignore "RE:lib/.*\\.o"

        Ignore everything but the "debian" toplevel directory::

            brz ignore "RE:(?!debian/).*"

        Ignore everything except the "local" toplevel directory,
        but always ignore autosave files ending in ~, even under local/::

      name should be in the same format as a committer-id, e.g.
      "John Doe <jdoe@example.com>". If there is more than one author of
      the change you can specify the option multiple times, once for each
      author.

    :Checks:

      A common mistake is to forget to add a new file or directory before
      running the commit command. The --strict option checks for unknown
      files and aborts the commit if any are found. More advanced pre-commit
      checks can be implemented by defining hooks. See ``brz help hooks``
      for details.

    :Things to note:

      If you accidentally commit the wrong changes or make a spelling
      mistake in the commit message say, you can use the uncommit command
      to undo it. See ``brz help uncommit`` for details.

      Hooks can also be configured to run after a commit. This allows you
      to trigger updates to external systems like bug trackers. The --fixes
      option can be used to record the association between a revision and
      one or more bugs. See ``brz help bugs`` for details.

    When the default format has changed after a major new release of
    Bazaar/Breezy, you may be informed during certain operations that you
    should upgrade. Upgrading to a newer format may improve performance
    or make new features available. It may however limit interoperability
    with older repositories or with older versions of Bazaar or Breezy.

    If you wish to upgrade to a particular format rather than the
    current default, that can be specified using the --format option.
    As a consequence, you can use the upgrade command this way to
    "downgrade" to an earlier format, though some conversions are
    a one way process (e.g. changing from the 1.x default to the
    2.x default) so downgrading is not always possible.

    A backup.bzr.~#~ directory is created at the start of the conversion
    process (where # is a number). By default, this is left there on
    completion. If the conversion fails, delete the new .bzr directory
    and rename this one back in its place. Use the --clean option to ask
    for the backup.bzr directory to be removed on successful conversion.
    Alternatively, you can delete it by hand if everything looks good
    afterwards.

    If the location given is a shared repository, dependent branches
    are also converted provided the repository converts successfully.
    If the conversion of a branch fails, remaining branches are still
    tried.

    If arguments are given, they are regular expressions that say which tests
    should run.  Tests matching any expression are run, and other tests are
    not run.

    Alternatively if --first is given, matching tests are run first and then
    all other tests are run.  This is useful if you have been working in a
    particular area, but want to make sure nothing else was broken.

    If --exclude is given, tests that match that regular expression are
    excluded, regardless of whether they match --first or not.

    To help catch accidential dependencies between tests, the --randomize
    option is useful. In most cases, the argument used is the word 'now'.
    Note that the seed used for the random number generator is displayed
    when this option is used. The seed can be explicitly passed as the
    argument to this option if required. This enables reproduction of the
    actual ordering used if and when an order sensitive problem is encountered.

    If --list-only is given, the tests that would be run are listed. This is
    useful when combined with --first, --exclude and/or --randomize to
    understand their impact. The test harness reports "Listed nn tests in ..."
    instead of "Ran nn tests in ..." when list mode is enabled.

    If the global option '--no-plugins' is given, plugins are not loaded
    before running the selftests.  This has two effects: features provided or
    modified by plugins will not be tested, and tests provided by plugins will
    not be run.

    Tests that need working space on disk use a common temporary directory,
    typically inside $TMPDIR or /tmp.

    If you set BRZ_TEST_PDB=1 when running selftest, failing tests will drop
    into a pdb postmortem session.

    The --coverage=DIRNAME global option produces a report with covered code
    indicated.

    :Examples:
        Run only tests relating to 'ignore'::

            brz selftest ignore

        Disable plugins and list tests as they're run::

class cmd_merge(Command):
    __doc__ = """Perform a three-way merge.

    The source of the merge can be specified either in the form of a branch,
    or in the form of a path to a file containing a merge directive generated
    with brz send. If neither is specified, the default is the upstream branch
    or the branch most recently merged using --remember.  The source of the
    merge may also be specified in the form of a path to a file in another
    branch:  in this case, only the modifications to that file are merged into
    the current working tree.

    When merging from a branch, by default brz will try to merge in all new
    work from the other branch, automatically determining an appropriate base
    revision.  If this fails, you may need to give an explicit base.

    To pick a different ending revision, pass "--revision OTHER".  brz will
    try to merge in all new work up to and including revision OTHER.

    If you specify two values, "--revision BASE..OTHER", only revisions BASE
    through OTHER, excluding BASE but including OTHER, will be merged.  If this
    causes some revisions to be skipped, i.e. if the destination branch does
    not already contain revision BASE, such a merge is commonly referred to as
    a "cherrypick". Unlike a normal merge, Breezy does not currently track
    cherrypicks. The changes look like a normal commit, and the history of the
    changes from the other branch is not stored in the commit.

    Revision numbers are always relative to the source branch.

    Merge will do its best to combine the changes in two branches, but there
    are some kinds of problems only a human can fix.  When it encounters those,
    it will mark a conflict.  A conflict means that you need to fix something,
    before you can commit.

    Use brz resolve when you have fixed a problem.  See also brz conflicts.

    If there is no default branch set, the first merge will set it (use
    --no-remember to avoid setting it). After that, you can omit the branch
    to use the default.  To change the default, use --remember. The value will
    only be saved if the remote location can be accessed.

    The results of the merge are placed into the destination working
    directory, where they can be reviewed (with brz diff), tested, and then
    committed to record the result of the merge.

    merge refuses to run if there are any uncommitted changes, unless
    --force is given.  If --force is given, then the changes from the source
    will be merged with the current working tree, including any uncommitted
    changes in the tree.  The --force option can also be used to create a
    merge revision which has more than two parents.

    If one would like to merge changes from the working tree of the other
    branch without merging any committed revisions, the --uncommitted option
    can be given.

    To select only some changes to merge, use "merge -i", which will prompt
    you to apply each diff hunk and file change, similar to "shelve".

    :Examples:
        To merge all new revisions from brz.dev::

            brz merge ../brz.dev

        To merge changes up to and including revision 82 from brz.dev::

            brz merge -r 82 ../brz.dev

        To merge the changes introduced by 82, without previous changes::

            brz merge -r 81..82 ../brz.dev

        To apply a merge directive contained in /tmp/merge::

            brz merge /tmp/merge

        To create a merge revision with three parents from two branches
        feature1a and feature1b:

            brz merge ../feature1a
            brz merge ../feature1b --force
            brz commit -m 'revision with three parents'

    __doc__ = """\
    Set files in the working tree back to the contents of a previous revision.

    Giving a list of files will revert only those files.  Otherwise, all files
    will be reverted.  If the revision is not specified with '--revision', the
    working tree basis revision is used. A revert operation affects only the
    working tree, not any revision history like the branch and repository or
    the working tree basis revision.

    To remove only some changes, without reverting to a prior version, use
    merge instead.  For example, "merge . -r -2..-3" (don't forget the ".")
    will remove the changes introduced by the second last commit (-2), without
    affecting the changes introduced by the last commit (-1).  To remove
    certain changes on a hunk-by-hunk basis, see the shelve command.
    To update the branch to a specific revision or the latest revision and
    update the working tree accordingly while preserving local changes, see the
    update command.

    Uncommitted changes to files that are reverted will be discarded.
    However, by default, any files that have been manually changed will be
    backed up first.  (Files changed only by merge are not backed up.)  Backup
    files have '.~#~' appended to their name, where # is a number.

    When you provide files, you can use their current pathname or the pathname
    from the target revision.  So you can use revert to "undelete" a file by
    name.  If you name a directory, all the contents of that directory will be
    reverted.

    If you have newly added files since the target revision, they will be
    removed.  If the files to be removed have been changed, backups will be
    created as above.  Directories containing unknown files will not be
    deleted.

    The working tree contains a list of revisions that have been merged but
    not yet committed. These revisions will be included as additional parents
    of the next commit.  Normally, using revert clears that list as well as
    reverting the files.  If any files are specified, revert leaves the list
    of uncommitted merges alone and reverts only the files.  Use ``brz revert
    .`` in the tree root to revert all files but keep the recorded merges,
    and ``brz revert --forget-merges`` to clear the pending merge list without
    reverting any files.

    Using "brz revert --forget-merges", it is possible to apply all of the
    changes from a branch in a single revision.  To do this, perform the merge
    as desired.  Then doing revert with the "--forget-merges" option will keep
    the content of the tree as it was, but it will clear the list of pending
    merges.  The next commit will then contain all of the changes that are
    present in the other branch, but without any other parent revisions.
    Because this technique forgets where these changes originated, it may
    cause additional conflicts on later merges involving the same source and
    target branches.

class cmd_send(Command):
    __doc__ = """Mail or create a merge-directive for submitting changes.

    A merge directive provides many things needed for requesting merges:

    * A machine-readable description of the merge to perform

    * An optional patch that is a preview of the changes requested

    * An optional bundle of revision data, so that the changes can be applied
      directly from the merge directive, without retrieving data from a
      branch.

    `brz send` creates a compact data set that, when applied using brz
    merge, has the same effect as merging from the source branch.

    By default the merge directive is self-contained and can be applied to any
    branch containing submit_branch in its ancestory without needing access to
    the source branch.

    If --no-bundle is specified, then Breezy doesn't send the contents of the
    revisions, but only a structured request to merge from the
    public_location.  In that case the public_branch is needed and it must be
    up-to-date and accessible to the recipient.  The public_branch is always
    included if known, so that people can check it later.

    The submit branch defaults to the parent of the source branch, but can be
    overridden.  Both submit branch and public branch will be remembered in
    branch.conf the first time they are used for a particular branch.  The
    source branch defaults to that containing the working directory, but can
    be changed using --from.

    Both the submit branch and the public branch follow the usual behavior with
    respect to --remember: If there is no default location set, the first send
    will set it (use --no-remember to avoid setting it). After that, you can
    omit the location to use the default.  To change the default, use
    --remember. The value will only be saved if the location can be accessed.

    In order to calculate those changes, brz must analyse the submit branch.
    Therefore it is most efficient for the submit branch to be a local mirror.
    If a public location is known for the submit_branch, that location is used
    in the merge directive.

    The default behaviour is to send the merge directive by mail, unless -o is
    given, in which case it is sent to a file.

    Mail is sent using your preferred mail program.  This should be transparent
    on Windows (it uses MAPI).  On Unix, it requires the xdg-email utility.
    If the preferred client can't be found (or used), your editor will be used.

    To use a specific mail program, set the mail_client configuration option.
    Supported values for specific clients are "claws", "evolution", "kmail",
    "mail.app" (MacOS X's Mail.app), "mutt", and "thunderbird"; generic options
    are "default", "editor", "emacsclient", "mapi", and "xdg-email".  Plugins
    may also add supported clients.

    If mail is being sent, a to address is required.  This can be supplied
    either on the commandline, by setting the submit_to configuration
    option in the branch itself or the child_submit_to configuration option
    in the submit branch.

    The merge directives created by brz send may be applied using brz merge or
    brz pull by specifying a file containing a merge directive as the location.

    brz send makes extensive use of public locations to map local locations into
    URLs that can be used by other people.  See `brz help configuration` to
    set them, and use `brz info` to display them.

class cmd_view(Command):
    __doc__ = """Manage filtered views.

    Views provide a mask over the tree so that users can focus on
    a subset of a tree when doing their work. After creating a view,
    commands that support a list of files - status, diff, commit, etc -
    effectively have that list of files implicitly given each time.
    An explicit list of files can still be given but those files
    must be within the current view.

    In most cases, a view has a short life-span: it is created to make
    a selected change and is deleted once that change is committed.
    At other times, you may wish to create one or more named views
    and switch between them.

    To disable the current view without deleting it, you can switch to
    the pseudo view called ``off``. This can be useful when you need
    to see the whole tree for an operation or two (e.g. merge) but
    want to switch back to your view after that.

    :Examples:
      To define the current view::

        brz view file1 dir1 ...

      To list the current view::

        brz view

      To delete the current view::

        brz view --delete

      To disable the current view without deleting it::

        brz view --switch off

      To define a named view and switch to it::

        brz view --name view-name file1 dir1 ...

      To list a named view::

        brz view --name view-name

      To delete a named view::

        brz view --name view-name --delete

      To switch to a named view::

    the shelf with the 'unshelve' command.  The changes are stored alongside
    your working tree, and so they aren't propagated along with your branch nor
    will they survive its deletion.

    If shelve --list is specified, previously-shelved changes are listed.

    Shelve is intended to help separate several sets of changes that have
    been inappropriately mingled.  If you just want to get rid of all changes
    and you don't need to restore them later, use revert.  If you want to
    shelve all text changes at once, use shelve --all.

    If filenames are specified, only the changes to those files will be
    shelved. Other files will be left untouched.

    If a revision is specified, changes since that revision will be shelved.

    You can put multiple items on the shelf, and by default, 'unshelve' will
    restore the most recently shelved changes.

    For complicated changes, it is possible to edit the changes in a separate
    editor program to decide what the file remaining in the working copy
    should look like.  To do this, add the configuration option

        change_editor = PROGRAM {new_path} {old_path}
