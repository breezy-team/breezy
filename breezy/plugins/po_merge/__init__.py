__doc__ = """Merge hook for ``.po`` files.

To enable this plugin, add a section to your branch.conf or location.conf
like::

    [/home/user/code/bzr]
    po_merge.pot_dirs = po,doc/po4a/po

The ``po_merge.pot_dirs`` config option takes a list of directories that can
contain ``.po`` files, separated by commas (if several directories are
needed). Each directory should contain a single ``.pot`` file.

The ``po_merge.command`` is the command whose output is used as the result of
the merge. It defaults to::

   msgmerge -N "{other}" "{pot_file}" -C "{this}" -o "{result}"

where:

* ``this`` is the ``.po`` file content before the merge in the current branch,
* ``other`` is the ``.po`` file content in the branch merged from,
* ``pot_file`` is the path to the ``.pot`` file corresponding to the ``.po``
  file being merged.

If conflicts occur in a ``.pot`` file during a given merge, the ``.po`` files
will use the ``.pot`` file present in tree before the merge. If this doesn't
suit your needs, you should can disable the plugin during the merge with::

  bzr merge <usual merge args> -Opo_merge.po_dirs=

This will allow you to resolve the conflicts in the ``.pot`` file and then
merge the ``.po`` files again with::

  bzr remerge po/*.po doc/po4a/po/*.po
