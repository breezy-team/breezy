Installation example:

<IfModule mod_dav.c>
Alias /bzr /srv/DAV
<Directory /srv/DAV>
	DAV On
	# DirectorySlash tells apache to reply with redirections if
	# directories miss their final '/'. It does not play well with
	# bzr (to they the least) and provide no benefits in our
	# case. So just turn it off.
	DirectorySlash Off
        # We need to activate the following which is off by
        # default. For good security reasons which don't apply to
        # bzr directories ;)
        DavDepthInfinity on
        # The simplest auth scheme is basic, just given as an
        # example, using https is recommanded with it, or at
        # least digest if https is not possible.
	AuthType Basic
	AuthName bzr
	AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/dav.users
	<LimitExcept GET OPTIONS>
                # Write access requires authentication
		Require valid-user
	</LimitExcept>
</Directory>
</IfModule>
