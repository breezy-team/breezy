This is the NEWS file from bzr-grep from before it was merged into bzr core.
For changes before then, please refer to the main bzr log file.

bzr-grep 0.5.0-final - Unreleased
==================================
* ``bzr grep`` now supports ``--diff|-p`` option to search through
  changesets. (Parth Malwankar, #540705)

* Option ``grep_color`` can be set in ``bazaar.conf`` instead of using
  the option ``--color`` from the command line. (Johan Dahlin)

bzr-grep 0.4.0-final - 08-Jun-2010
==================================
* Add seperate output formatter to reduce duplication of search loops,
  additionally make -Fi use regexp rather than lowercasing pattern and
  entirety of text for the same reason. This also fixes bug #590589
  - UnicodeDecodeError with options -Fi. (Martin [gz])

* Added fast path for no match that avoids splitting the file text into
  seperate lines and testing each one, by checking the entire text for a
  possible match initially. (Martin [gz])

* Added Makefile. (Parth Malwankar)

* Fixed setup.py to work correctly. (Martin [gz])

bzr-grep 0.3.0-final - 23-May-2010
==================================
* Support for --color option (POSIX only). (Parth Malwankar, #571694)

* Revisions in branches without trees can now be searched with
  -r option. (Parth Malwankar, #584240)

* Trying to search working tree for a treeless branch no longer
  produces a stack trace but gives an error message suggesting use of
  -r option. (Parth Malwankar, #572658)

bzr-grep 0.2.0-final - 30-Mar-2010
==================================
* 'binary file skipped' warning is not shows without --verbose flag
  (Parth Malwankar, #539031)

* Added support for -F/--fixed-string for faster search.
  Simple patterns [a-zA-Z0-9 _] are now implicitly -F and searched faster.
  (Parth Malwankar, #539263)

* Better unicode handling. bzr-grep no longer crashes with UnicodeDecode
  error for some outputs. (Parth Malwankar, #539258)

  files that have not changed between revisions.
