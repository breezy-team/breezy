__doc__ = """Merge hook for GNU-format ChangeLog files

To enable this plugin, add a section to your locations.conf
like::

    [/home/user/proj]
    changelog_merge_files = ChangeLog

Or add an entry to your branch.conf like::

    changelog_merge_files = ChangeLog

The changelog_merge_files config option takes a list of file names (not paths),
separated by commas.  (This is unlike the news_merge plugin, which matches
paths.)  e.g. the above config examples would match both
``src/foolib/ChangeLog`` and ``docs/ChangeLog``.

The algorithm used to merge the changes can be summarised as:

 * new entries added to the top of OTHER are emitted first
 * all other additions, deletions and edits from THIS and OTHER are preserved
 * edits (e.g. to fix typos) at the top of OTHER are hard to distinguish from
   adding and deleting independent entries; the algorithm tries to guess which
   based on how similar the old and new entries are.

Caveats
-------

Most changes can be merged, but conflicts are possible if the plugin finds
edits at the top of OTHER to entries that have been deleted (or also edited) by
THIS.  In that case the plugin gives up and bzr's default merge logic will be
used.

No effort is made to deduplicate entries added by both sides.

The results depend on the choice of the 'base' version, so it might give
strange results if there is a criss-cross merge.
