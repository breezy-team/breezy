======

status: Open (Work In Progress) "wip"

 More work is being done by the original author; changes have not been merged
 and the merge proposal is not ready for review.

status: Closed (Merged) "merged"

 The change has been merged. No further actions are expected.

 On Launchpad, this means that the merge proposal is frozen - the branch can
 be reused.

status: Closed (Rejected) "rejected"

 The branch has been rejected. Changes were not merged. The branch and merge
 proposal should be kept around so we don't create a new branch proposal
 with the same changes.

 Requires human follow-up.

status: Closed (Obsolete) "obsolete"

 Can happen e.g. when the changes are made independently by somebody else.

status: Open (Waiting Review) "waiting-review"

 The merge proposal is ready and waiting for review from a reviewer.

status: Open (Waiting Follow-up) "waiting-followup"

 The merge proposal is waiting for the original author to follow up to comments
 from a reviewer.
