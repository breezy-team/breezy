SVN support
===========

Status: Draft

Aim
---

Thanks to Jelmer's great work Bazaar is able to work well against an SVN
repository. It would be desirable for builddeb to use this and support SVN
wherever Bazaar is used. This includes the package branch itself and when
export-upstream is used.

It would also be great if packages that are normally built with
svn-buildpackage to be supported as-is. This would make migration easier, and
mean that one dev on a team could use Bazaar if the rest wanted SVN. This 
would require bzr-svn to somehow expose the Subversion file properties used 
by svn-buildpackage, in particular ``mergeWithUpstream''. bzr-builddeb 
would then also need support to use this data.

The first thing to do is to audit the current code to see how well it works
in these cases. Apparently Jelmer has tried export-upstream against an SVN
repo and it worked. I think the package building may work if it is set up
in builddeb's style, but not otherwise. Once this is done it should be
worked out how bzr-svn can help to access the needed information, (e.g. the
property used to indicate a merge build).
