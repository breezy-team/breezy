Building a remote branch
========================

Status: Implemented

Aim
---

It would be really cool to be able to build a package from a remote branch,
so that you could just point it at a URL and get a package out of it.

It has benifits like easy one-off building of a package, and limiting the
amount that has to be downloaded.

Design
------

Bazaar transparently supports accessing a remote branch, so that part should
be easy. However some of the current builddeb code and design assumes that the
branch is local.

For instance the build directory can be given relative to a branch. This loses
it's meaning when the branch is remote. Either this could be ignored, it could
be used, or everything could be done in the current directory.

The first and second options might be unexpected, but it is not that different
to a local branch. The last option might be best, but it makes the operation
less transparent.

Code Changes
------------

  * Open the branch at the given location rather than cding to it.
  * Audit the code for it's use of directories.
  * Audit the code for other assumptions that the branch is local
