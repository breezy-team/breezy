Fetching the upstream tarball from some other location
------------------------------------------------------

Status: Implemented
Version: 0.18

Rationale
=========

For a user of the plugin who is using a non-bzr upstream mode, but is not
upstream they will have to get download the tarball from a website of FTP
site or similar.

In order to make moving to a new upstream version in this case easier
the plugin could look for the tarball in a remote location if it's not found
locally, then download it and place it locally.

It's not a huge win, but it does mean that if it is set up correctly a new
upstream just needs dch to try and test build.

Design
======

If a watch file is included in the package, and the tarball is not found then
uscan is asked to retrieve the desired version. It is then repacked if
necessary and placed in the orig-dir so the build can be done, and the
download wont have to be done next time.
