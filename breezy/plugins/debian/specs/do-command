Do Command
==========

Status: Partial Implementation
Version: 0.91

Rationale
---------

When a user is using merge mode and they need to do something that operates
on the whole package it is difficult to do so as the upstream code is not
usually there.

svn-buildpackage has an svn-do script with it that supports this by exporting
the whole package, executing a command and copying the resulting directory
back.

Design
------

For merge mode packages use the builder's export function to export to
a temporary directory. Then execute the user's command (default to $SHELL)
in that directory. If it returns with a non-zero exit code then consider it
a failure and return. If not then copy the contents of debian/ back to the
branch (taking in to account whether debian/ is in the branch, or just the
contents).

Provide an option to the user to not purge the temporary directory, as this
will help with debugging why a command failed. Perhaps also have an option to
consider all commands succesful.
