Hooks
=====

Status: Partial Implementation
Version: 0.91

Rationale
---------

Sometimes there may need to be operations done on the source tree to prepare
for building that are not appropriate for debian/rules. For instance running
autotools on the source in order to have the configure script available for
use in the source package.

To accomodate all requirements hooks can be supported to run a command at
a predefined point.

Design
------

The user speficies the hooks using a ``[HOOKS]`` section in the configuration
files. The key is the name of the hook point, and the value is the command
to run at that hook point.

In order to protect new users from the surprise of code being run from an
unexpected location hook support could be required to be enabled for hooks
to be executed for that user. This would however cause unexpected build
failures that could be hard to debug, and so in balance the safety may not
be worth it.
