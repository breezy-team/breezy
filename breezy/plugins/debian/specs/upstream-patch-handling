Handling of patches against upstream
====================================

Status: Draft

Aim
---

Patching upstream sources, either to backport a fix or to add a Debian specific
change is very common. It is desirable to do it in a way in which the changes
are separate, and can easily be handled when moving to a new upstream. This
usually means storing them in ``debian/patches/`` and using a system like
quilt to handle them.

This works OK in a full source branch as is. However merge mode for instance
requires more work. The tool could certainly help in doing this.

The requirements are:

  * Seamless handling of patches regardless of the mode.
  * Conformance with standard handling practices.
  * Easy way to move to new upstream version.
  * Integration with the VCS wherever possible.
