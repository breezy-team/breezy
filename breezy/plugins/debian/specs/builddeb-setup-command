A command to help when starting a new package with builddeb
===========================================================

Status: Draft

Rationale
---------

When a new user of the plugin (or even an old user with a new package) wants
to setup or convert a branch to use builddeb then they might need to set
various options.

There are several modes to work in, and if the wrong one is selected the
user probably can't build unless they work out what option is needed. The
plugin can help here with helpful error messages to suggest why an error might
happen. However if the setup is completely wrong then it might take the user
a while.

Also doing this might allow more explicit choices to be recorded, rather
than having to infer them, perhaps helping with the
new-upstream-release-handling and it's ilk.

If there are sources provided the branch can be initialised with some history.

Design
------

A command could be added that interactively asked questions about how the
user wanted to work, and stored the values in config files, so that a bzr bd
would then build the package how they wanted.

It could also actually create branches and things as well if needed, though
a first pass might just do config files and suggest the next steps.

The number of combinations might be huge, depending on how much the command
wanted to "help".

I'm not sure how the command should behave if it detects a configured branch.
On one hand it might make it more complicated, on the other a user will
probably want to re-run it to correct any mistakes. Perhaps a separate command
could support configuration at any time, but it would probably share a lot of
code and so be largely redundant to have two commands.

Code Changes
------------

 * New command to implement this.
 * Knowledge in the command of what parts a certain configuration requires.
 * Ability to work out what bits are extant.
 * Perhaps the ability to create branches, import tarballs etc. though bzrlib
   and bzrtools might be useful here.
