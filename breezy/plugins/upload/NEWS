Testing
*******

* Now requires bzr >= 2.5 for testing. The plugin itself should still work
  with previous versions. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Avoid deprecation warning with bzr-2.5 by using tree.iter_entries_by_dir
  avoiding direct inventory access, this should still be compatible with
  older bzr versions. (Vincent Ladeuil)

bzr-upload 1.0.1
################

:1.0.1: 2012-03-15

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix a typo to avoid crashing when encountering symlinks during
  a full upload. (Jonathan Paugh)

Testing
*******

* Use assertPathDoesNotExist and assertPathExist instead of failIfExists and
  failUnlessExists in the test suite. This requires bzr-2.4 to run the tests
  but doesn't affect the plugin compatibility itself with previous versions
  of bzr. (Vincent Ladeuil)


bzr-upload 1.0.0
################

:1.0.0: 2010-12-10

New Features
************

* ``.bzrignore-upload`` can be used to avoid uploading some files or
  directories. It uses the same syntax as ``.bzrignore`` including regular
  expressions.
  (Martin Albisetti, Vincent Ladeuil, #499525, #499941)

* Remote branches can be used to upload from.
  (Gary van der Merwe, Vincent Ladeuil)

* The auto hook verbosity is now controlled by the 'upload_auto_quiet'
  config variable. If defaults to False if not set.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #312686)

* The file where the revision id is stored on the remote server is now
  controlled by the 'upload_revid_location' configuration variable. It
  defaults to '.bzr-upload.revid'.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #423331)

* Upload now checks that the revision we are uploading is a descendent
  from the revision that was uploaded, and hence that the branches that
  they were uploaded from have not diverged. This can be ignored by passing
  the --overwrite option. (Gary van der Merwe)


Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix auto hook trying to display an url without using the right encoding.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #312686)

* Fix compatibility with bzr versions that don't provide
  get_user_option_as_bool().
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #423791)

* Emit warnings instead of backtrace when symlinks are encountered.
 (Vincent Ladeuil, #477224)

Documentation
*************

* Clarify 'changes' definition in online help.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #275538)

* Move the README file into the module doc string so that it
  becomes available through the 'bzr help plugins/upload'
  command.  (Vincent Ladeuil, #424193)

Testing
*******

* Make tests requiring a unicode file system skip where applicable.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #671964)
