Missing Extensions
==================

Breezy gives a warning if it failed to load some compiled extensions. (See
http://bazaarvcs.wordpress.com/2009/09/17/extension-warnings/ for background.)

This may indicate either that there's been a problem installing or packaging
Breezy, or it may just be a case where you don't want to use the compiled
extensions.

1. If you installed Breezy from an official binary package or a distribution
and you're seeing this warning, please report a bug.

2. If you're running Breezy from a source tree or tarball, please run 'make' in
that directory to compile the extensions. You should do this every time you
update the tree. To do this you will need some build dependencies installed
including make, a C compiler, and the Python header files.

3. If you can't or don't want to build the extensions, add this line to
breezy.conf (whose location is shown by 'brz --version')::

  suppress_warnings=missing_extensions

Breezy will work normally but some operations may be slower.

The specific modules that failed, and why, are listed in brz.log.
