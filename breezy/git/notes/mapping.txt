Mapping between Git and Bazaar is generally straightforward.

Mapping version 1
=================

All revision ids created in this mapping format are prefixed with "git-v1:". 
This mapping format does not support roundtripped revisions from Bazaar; 
pushing or pulling from Bazaar into Git is not possible. dpush is possible 
and more or less does the opposite of the mapping described in this section.

Commits
-------

Git commits are mapped to Bazaar revisions. 

Bazaar revision ids are created by prefixing the (hex format) of git commit 
sha with "git-v1:". 

Commit properties are as follows:

 * git committer string: mapped to the Bazaar committer string
 * git committer timestamp: mapped to the Bazaar commit timestamp
 * git author string: mapped to the Bazaar 'author' revision property, if it 
   is different from the committer string
 * git author timestamp: ignored
 * git commit message: mapped to Bazaar commit message

The git committer string, author string and commit message are assumed to 
be encoded in UTF-8. Any utf-8-invalid characters are ignored.

Trees and blobs
---------------
Git trees are generally converted to Bazaar directories, Git blobs are 
generally converted to Bazaar files and symlinks.

Since all git trees are mapped *including* the root tree, it is only possible 
to create mapped rich-root revisions.

File ids for all objects are simply created by taking their path and 
escaping invalid characters in them:

 * _ is mapped to __
 * spaces are mapped to _s
 * \x0c is mapped to _c
