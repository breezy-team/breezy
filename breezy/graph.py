        This algorithm has two phases.  Phase 1 identifies border ancestors,

        common ancestors.  This is done by searching the ancestries of each
        border ancestor.

        Phase 2 is perfomed on the principle that a border ancestor that is
        not an ancestor of any other border ancestor is a least common
        ancestor.

        Searches are stopped when they find a node that is determined to be a
