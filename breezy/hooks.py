Hooks

Introduction
------------

A hook of type *xxx* of class *yyy* needs to be registered using::

  yyy.hooks.install_named_hook("xxx", ...)

See :doc:`Using hooks<../user-guide/hooks>` in the User Guide for examples.

The class that contains each hook is given before the hooks it supplies. For
instance, BranchHooks as the class is the hooks class for
`breezy.branch.Branch.hooks`.

Each description also indicates whether the hook runs on the client (the
machine where bzr was invoked) or the server (the machine addressed by
the branch URL).  These may be, but are not necessarily, the same machine.

Plugins (including hooks) are run on the server if all of these is true:

  * The connection is via a smart server (accessed with a URL starting with
    "bzr://", "bzr+ssh://" or "bzr+http://", or accessed via a "http://"
    URL when a smart server is available via HTTP).

  * The hook is either server specific or part of general infrastructure rather
    than client specific code (such as commit).
