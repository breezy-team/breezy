"""Exceptions for bzr, and reporting of them.

This module defines the exception hierarchy used throughout Breezy. All Breezy-specific
exceptions inherit from BzrError, which provides a consistent interface for formatting
error messages.

The module includes exceptions for:
- General errors (BzrError and its subclasses)
- Path and filesystem errors (PathError and subclasses)
- Version control errors (NotBranchError, NoSuchRevision, etc.)
- Lock-related errors (LockError and subclasses)
- Transport and network errors (TransportError and subclasses)
- Repository and format errors
- User interface errors (CommandError)

# TODO: is there any value in providing the .args field used by standard
# python exceptions?   A list of values with no names seems less useful
# to me.

# TODO: Perhaps convert the exception to a string at the moment it's
# constructed to make sure it will succeed.  But that says nothing about
# exceptions that are never raised.

# TODO: selftest assertRaises should probably also check that every error
# raised can be formatted as a string successfully, and without giving
# 'unprintable'.
