"""Matchers for breezy.

Primarily test support, Matchers are used by self.assertThat in the breezy
test suite. A matcher is a stateful test helper which can be used to determine
if a passed object 'matches', much like a regex. If the object does not match
the mismatch can be described in a human readable fashion. assertThat then
raises if a mismatch occurs, showing the description as the assertion error.

Matchers are designed to be more reusable and composable than layered
assertions in Test Case objects, so they are recommended for new testing work.
