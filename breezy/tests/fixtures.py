"""Fixtures that can be used within tests.

Fixtures can be created during a test as a way to separate out creation of
objects to test.  Fixture objects can hold some state so that different
objects created during a test instance can be related.  Normally a fixture
should live only for the duration of a single test, and its tearDown method
should be passed to `addCleanup` on the test.
