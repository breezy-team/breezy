"""Tests for WorkingTree.revision_tree.

These tests are in addition to the tests from
per_tree.test_revision_tree which cover the behaviour expected from
all Trees. WorkingTrees implement the revision_tree api to allow access to
cached data, but we don't require that all WorkingTrees have such a cache,
so these tests are testing that when there is a cache, it performs correctly.
