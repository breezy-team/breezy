    # by a brz operation on PATH, are candidates that break-lock may unlock.
    # so pathologically if we have a lightweight checkout A, of branch B, which
    # is bound to location C, the following things should be checked for locks
    # to break:
    # wt = WorkingTree(A)
    # wt.branch
    # wt.branch.repository
    # wt.branch.get_master_branch()
    # wt.branch.get_master_branch().repository

    # and we can then use different urls to test individual cases, for as much
    # granularity as needed.
