"""Checking of bzr objects.

check_refs is a concept used for optimising check. Objects that depend on other
objects (e.g. tree on repository) can list the objects they would be requesting
so that when the dependent object is checked, matches can be pulled out and
evaluated in-line rather than re-reading the same data many times.
check_refs are tuples (kind, value). Currently defined kinds are:

* 'trees', where value is a revid and the looked up objects are revision trees.
* 'lefthand-distance', where value is a revid and the looked up objects are the
  distance along the lefthand path to NULL for that revid.
* 'revision-existence', where value is a revid, and the result is True or False
  indicating that the revision was found/not found.
