"""Implementation of Transport over SFTP, using paramiko."""

# TODO: Remove the transport-based lock_read and lock_write methods.  They'll
# then raise TransportNotPossible, which will break remote access to any
# formats which rely on OS-level locks.  That should be fine as those formats
# are pretty old, but these combinations may have to be removed from the test
# suite.  Those formats all date back to 0.7; so we should be able to remove
# these methods when we officially drop support for those formats.
