"""Working tree content filtering support.

A filter consists of a read converter, write converter pair.
The content in the working tree is called the convenience format
while the content actually stored is called the canonical format.
The read converter produces canonical content from convenience
content while the writer goes the other way.

Converters have the following signatures::

    read_converter(chunks) -> chunks
    write_converter(chunks, context) -> chunks

where:

 * chunks is an iterator over a sequence of byte strings

 * context is an optional ContentFilterContent object (possibly None)
   providing converters access to interesting information, e.g. the
   relative path of the file.

Note that context is currently only supported for write converters.
