    Often we will provide convenience methods on the objects which carry out
    operations with another of similar type - they will always forward to
    a subclass of InterObject - i.e.
    InterVersionedFile.get(other).method_name(parameters).

    If the source and target objects implement the locking protocol -
    lock_read, lock_write, unlock, then the InterObject's lock_read,
    lock_write and unlock methods may be used.

    When looking for an inter, the most recently registered types are tested
    first.  So typically the most generic and slowest InterObjects should be
    registered first.
