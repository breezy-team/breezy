"""All of bzr.

Developer documentation is available at
https://www.breezy-vcs.org/developers/.

Some particularly interesting things in breezy are:

 * breezy.initialize -- setup the library for use
 * breezy.plugin.load_plugins -- load all installed plugins
 * breezy.branch.Branch.open -- open a branch
 * breezy.workingtree.WorkingTree.open -- open a working tree

We hope you enjoy this library.
