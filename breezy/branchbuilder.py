    r"""A BranchBuilder aids creating Branches with particular shapes.

    The expected way to use BranchBuilder is to construct a
    BranchBuilder on the transport you want your branch on, and then call
    appropriate build_ methods on it to get the shape of history you want.

    This is meant as a helper for the test suite, not as a general class for
    real data.

    For instance:

    >>> from breezy.transport.memory import MemoryTransport
    >>> builder = BranchBuilder(MemoryTransport("memory:///"))
    >>> builder.start_series()
    >>> builder.build_snapshot(None, [
    ...     ('add', ('', b'root-id', 'directory', '')),
    ...     ('add', ('filename', b'f-id', 'file', b'content\n'))],
    ...     revision_id=b'rev-id')
    b'rev-id'
    >>> builder.build_snapshot([b'rev-id'],
    ...     [('modify', ('filename', b'new-content\n'))],
    ...     revision_id=b'rev2-id')
    b'rev2-id'
    >>> builder.finish_series()
    >>> branch = builder.get_branch()

    :ivar _tree: This is a private member which is not meant to be modified by
        users of this class. While a 'series' is in progress, it should hold a
        MemoryTree with the contents of the last commit (ready to be modified
        by the next build_snapshot command) with a held write lock. Outside of
        a series in progress, it should be None.
