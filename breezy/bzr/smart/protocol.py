    This class provides infrastructure for building protocol parsers that can

    - Buffered input handling for incomplete data
    - State machine architecture with pluggable state functions

    This utility function provides a safer way to iterate over potentially
    problematic iterables by isolating exceptions that occur during iteration
    from exceptions that might occur in the consuming code.

    The function yields (exc_info, value) tuples:
    - (None, value): Normal iteration, value is from iterable
    - (exc_info, None): Exception occurred, exc_info is sys.exc_info() tuple

    Usage example::

        for exc_info, value in _iter_with_errors(stream):
            if exc_info is not None:
                # Handle the exception from iteration

            else:
                # Process the value normally
                process(value)

    This is safer than a try/except around a for loop because it only catches
    exceptions from the iterator's next() method, not from the loop body.

    Args:
        iterable: Any iterable object to iterate over safely.

    Yields:
        Tuples of (exc_info, value):
        - exc_info: None for normal values, sys.exc_info() tuple for errors
        - value: Iterator value or None when exc_info is not None

    Note:
        KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit are not caught and will propagate
        normally to allow proper program termination.
