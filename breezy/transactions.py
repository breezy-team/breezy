"""This module provides a transactional facility.

Transactions provide hooks to allow data objects (i.e. inventory weaves or
the revision-history file) to be placed in a registry and retrieved later
during the same transaction. Transactions in bzr are not atomic - they
depend on data ordering of writes, so we do not have commit or rollback
facilities at the transaction level.

Read only transactions raise an assert when objects are listed as dirty
against them - preventing unintended writes.

Write transactions preserve dirty objects in the cache, though due to the
write ordering approach we use for consistency 'dirty' is a misleading term.
A dirty object is one we have modified.

Both read and write transactions *may* flush unchanged objects out of
memory, unless they are marked as 'precious' which indicates that
repeated reads cannot be obtained if the object is ejected, or that
the object is an expensive one for obtaining.
