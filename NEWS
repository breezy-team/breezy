bzr (0.16~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

 * This release changes the behaviour of `bzr remove/rm` to remove the working
   file if it could be recovered again. If you prefer keeping the file
   instead, issue the --keep option to rm and/or consider using an alias that
   always sets it (see /usr/share/doc/bzr/txt/using_aliases.txt)
   If it so happens that a file gets unexpectedly deleted, use 
   `bzr revert <file>` to get it back.

bzr (0.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

 * Versions of bzr prior to 0.7 had users setting their email address in
   ~/.bzr.conf/email.  This has changed; email addresses are
   now set either via environment variables ($BZREMAIL or $EMAIL) or
   through the config file ~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf.  See the bzr(1) man
   page for more details.

bzr (0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

 * This release updates the bzr tree-format, and old trees will not be
   usable until they are upgraded with "bzr upgrade".  This should
   proceed smoothly, but the old .bzr dir is backed up to .bzr.backup
   should anything go wrong.
