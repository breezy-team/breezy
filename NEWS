Compatibility Breaks
********************


New Features
************

* ``.bzrignore-upload`` can be used to avoid uploading some files or
  directories. It uses the same syntax as ``.bzrignore`` including regular
  expressions.
  (Martin Albisetti, Vincent Ladeuil, #499525, #499941)

* Remote branches can be used to upload from.
  (Gary van der Merwe, Vincent Ladeuil)

* The auto hook verbosity is now controlled by the 'upload_auto_quiet'
  config variable. If defaults to False if not set.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #312686)

* The file where the revision id is stored on the remote server is now
  controlled by the 'upload_revid_location' configuration variable. It
  defaults to '.bzr-upload.revid'.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #423331)

* Upload now checks that the revision we are uploading is a descendent
  from the revision that was uploaded, and hence that the branchs that
  they were uploaded from have not diverged. This can be ignored by passing
  the --overwrite option. (Gary van der Merwe)


Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix auto hook trying to display an url without using the right encoding.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #312686)

* Fix compatibility with bzr versions that don't provide
  get_user_option_as_bool().
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #423791)

* Emit warnings instead of backtrace when symlinks are encountered.
 (Vincent Ladeuil, #477224)

Improvements

  (Vincent Ladeuil, #275538)

  becomes available through the 'bzr help plugins/upload'
  command.  (Vincent Ladeuil, #424193)
