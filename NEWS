    better interoperability with bzr-hg.

    (Jelmer Vernooij)

  * Fix handling of not-executable files becoming executable without any 
    other changes. (#382609)

  * XML-invalid characters are now no longer squashed if not required by 
    the target repository serializer format. The only non-XML based format 
	at the moment is the "2a" development format supported since bzr 1.16.

  * Unusual file modes that could be created in Git repositories using older
    versions of Git are now stored in Bazaar revision properties. This means 
	it's now possible to import the Git repository and the Linux kernel repository.

  * Mark as compatible with bzr 1.16.

0.3.2	2009-05-20

 FEATURES

  * "bzr commit" in git working trees works to some extent.

0.3.1	2009-05-13

 FEATURES

  * Alternative (faster) storage for SHA map using the TDB library
    (http://tdb.samba.org/). This will automatically be used if you have 
	TDB and its Python bindings installed. In all other situations the previous
	(slower) Sqlite database format will be used.

  * Now warns when escaping XML-invalid characters to work around a bug in the
    Bazaar revision serializer.

  * Now allows "unusual" file modes (100664, etc) but will warn the user about
    them.

 BUG FIXES

  * Fixed git-import.

  * Fixed handling kind changes (tree -> blob) during fetch.

0.3.0	2009-05-10

 FEATURES

  * Support parsing .gitignore

  * Support dpushing to remote repositories.
