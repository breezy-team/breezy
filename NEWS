   :depth: 1

bzr 2.0.3
#########

:Codename: little italy
:2.0.3: 2009-12-14


The third stable release of Bazaar has a small handful of bugfixes. As
expected, this has no internal or external compatibility changes versus
2.0.2 (or 2.0.0).

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr push --use-existing-dir`` no longer crashes if the directory
  exists but contains an invalid ``.bzr`` directory.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #423563)

* Content filters are now applied correctly after pull, merge and switch.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #385879)

* Fix a potential segfault in the groupcompress hash map handling code.
  When inserting new entries, if the final hash bucket was empty, we could
  end up trying to access if ``(last_entry+1)->ptr == NULL``.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #490228)

* Improve "Binary files differ" hunk handling.  (Aaron Bentley, #436325)


bzr 2.0.2
#########

:Codename: after the scare
:2.0.2: 2009-11-02

The second in our "let's keep the stable bugfixes flowing" series. As
expected this has a few (~9) bugfixes relative to 2.0.1, and no major api
changes or features.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Avoid "NoneType has no attribute st_mode" error when files disappear
  from a directory while it's being read.  (Martin Pool, #446033)

* Content filters are now applied correctly after revert.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Diff parsing handles "Binary files differ" hunks.  (Aaron Bentley, #436325)

* Fetching from stacked pre-2a repository via a smart server no longer
  fails intermittently with "second push failed to complete".
  (Andrew Bennetts, #437626)

* Fix typos left after test_selftest refactoring.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, Matt Nordhoff, #461149)

* Fixed ``ObjectNotLocked`` errors during ``bzr log -r NNN somefile``.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #445171)
  
* PreviewTree file names are not limited by the encoding of the temp
  directory's filesystem. (Aaron Bentley, #436794)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr log`` now read-locks branches exactly once, so makes better use of
  data caches.  (Andrew Bennetts)

Documentation
*************

* Filtered views user documentation upgraded to refer to format 2a
  instead of pre-2.0 formats. (Ian Clatworthy)


bzr 2.0.1
#########

:Codename: Stability First
:2.0.1: 2009-10-14

The first of our new ongoing bugfix-only stable releases has arrived. It
includes a collection of 12 bugfixes applied to bzr 2.0.0, but does not
include any of the feature development in the 2.1.0 series.


Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr add`` in a tree that has files with ``\r`` or ``\n`` in the
  filename will issue a warning and skip over those files.
  (Robert Collins, #3918)

* bzr will attempt to authenticate with SSH servers that support
  ``keyboard-interactive`` auth but not ``password`` auth when using
  Paramiko.   (Andrew Bennetts, #433846)

* Fixed fetches from a stacked branch on a smart server that were failing
  with some combinations of remote and local formats.  This was causing
  "unknown object type identifier 60" errors.  (Andrew Bennetts, #427736)

* Fixed ``ObjectNotLocked`` errors when doing some log and diff operations
  on branches via a smart server.  (Andrew Bennetts, #389413)

* Handle things like ``bzr add foo`` and ``bzr rm foo`` when the tree is
  at the root of a drive. ``osutils._cicp_canonical_relpath`` always
  assumed that ``abspath()`` returned a path that did not have a trailing
  ``/``, but that is not true when working at the root of the filesystem.
  (John Arbash Meinel, Jason Spashett, #322807)

* Hide deprecation warnings for 'final' releases for python2.6.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #440062)

* Improve the time for ``bzr log DIR`` for 2a format repositories.
  We had been using the same code path as for <2a formats, which required
  iterating over all objects in all revisions.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #374730)

* Make sure that we unlock the tree if we fail to create a TreeTransform
  object when doing a merge, and there is limbo, or pending-deletions
  directory.  (Gary van der Merwe, #427773)

* Occasional IndexError on renamed files have been fixed. Operations that
  set a full inventory in the working tree will now go via the
  apply_inventory_delta code path which is simpler and easier to
  understand than dirstates set_state_from_inventory method. This may
  have a small performance impact on operations built on _write_inventory,
  but such operations are already doing full tree scans, so no radical
  performance change should be observed. (Robert Collins, #403322)

* Retrieving file text or mtime from a _PreviewTree has good performance when
  there are many changes.  (Aaron Bentley)

* The CHK index pages now use an unlimited cache size. With a limited
  cache and a large project, the random access of chk pages could cause us
  to download the entire cix file many times.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #402623)

* When a file kind becomes unversionable after being added, a sensible
  error will be shown instead of a traceback. (Robert Collins, #438569)

Documentation
*************

* Improved README. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Improved upgrade documentation for Launchpad branches.
  (Barry Warsaw)


bzr 2.0.0
#########

:2.0.0: 2009-09-22
:Codename: Instant Karma

This release of Bazaar makes the 2a (previously 'brisbane-core') format
the default when new branches or repositories are created.  This format is
substantially smaller and faster for many operations.  Most of the work in
this release focuses on bug fixes and stabilization, covering both 2a and
previous formats.  (See the Upgrade Guide for information on migrating
existing projects.)

This release also improves the documentation content and presentation,
including adding Windows HtmlHelp manuals.

The Bazaar team decided that 2.0 will be a long-term supported release,
with bugfix-only 2.0.x releases based on it, continuing for at least six
months or until the following stable release.

Changes from 2.0.0rc2 to final
******************************

* Officially branded as 2.0.0 rather than 2.0 to clarify between things
  that "want to happen on the 2.0.x stable series" versus things that want
  to "land in 2.0.0". (Changes how bzrlib._format_version_tuple() handles
  micro = 0.) (John Arbash Meinel)

bzr 2.0.0rc2
############

:2.0.0rc2: 2009-09-10

New Features
************

* Added post_commit hook for mutable trees. This allows the keywords
  plugin to expand keywords on files changed by the commit.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #408841)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Bazaar's native protocol code now correctly handles EINTR, which most
  noticeably occurs if you break in to the debugger while connected to a
  bzr+ssh server.  You can now can continue from the debugger (by typing
  'c') and the process continues.  However, note that pressing C-\ in the
  shell may still kill the SSH process, which is bug 162509, so you must
  sent a signal to the bzr process specifically, for example by typing
  ``kill -QUIT PID`` in another shell.  (Martin Pool, #341535)

* ``bzr check`` in pack-0.92, 1.6 and 1.9 format repositories will no
  longer report incorrect errors about ``Missing inventory ('TREE_ROOT', ...)``
  (Robert Collins, #416732)

* ``bzr info -v`` on a 2a format still claimed that it was a "Development
  format" (John Arbash Meinel, #424392)

* ``bzr log stacked-branch`` shows the full log including
  revisions that are in the fallback repository. (Regressed in 2.0rc1).
  (John Arbash Meinel, #419241)

* Clearer message when Bazaar runs out of memory, instead of a ``MemoryError``
  traceback.  (Martin Pool, #109115)

* Conversion to 2a will create a single pack for all the new revisions (as
  long as it ran without interruption). This improves both ``bzr upgrade``
  and ``bzr pull`` or ``bzr merge`` from local branches in older formats.
  The autopack logic that occurs every 100 revisions during local
  conversions was not returning that pack's identifier, which resulted in
  the partial packs created during the conversion not being consolidated
  at the end of the conversion process. (Robert Collins, #423818)

* Fetches from 2a to 2a are now again requested in 'groupcompress' order.
  Groups that are seen as 'underutilized' will be repacked on-the-fly.
  This means that when the source is fully packed, there is minimal
  overhead during the fetch, but if the source is poorly packed the result
  is a fairly well packed repository (not as good as 'bzr pack' but
  good-enough.) (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel, #402652)

* Fix a potential segmentation fault when doing 'log' of a branch that had
  ghosts in its mainline.  (Evaluating None as a tuple is bad.)
  (John Arbash Meinel, #419241)

* Fix a segmentation fault when computing the ``merge_sort`` of a graph
  that has a ghost in the mainline ancestry.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #419241)

* ``groupcompress`` sort order is now more stable, rather than relying on
  ``topo_sort`` ordering. The implementation is now
  ``KnownGraph.gc_sort``. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Local data conversion will generate correct deltas. This is a critical
  bugfix vs 2.0rc1, and all 2.0rc1 users should upgrade to 2.0rc2 before
  converting repositories. (Robert Collins, #422849)

* Network streams now decode adjacent records of the same type into a
  single stream, reducing layering churn. (Robert Collins)

* Prevent some kinds of incomplete data from being committed to a 2a
  repository, such as revisions without inventories, a missing chk_bytes
  record for an inventory, or a missing text referenced by an inventory.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #423506, #406687)
  
Documentation
*************

* Fix assertion error about "_remember_remote_is_before" when pushing to
  older smart servers.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #418931)

* Help on hooks no longer says 'Not deprecated' for hooks that are
  currently supported. (Ian Clatworthy, #422415)

* PDF and CHM (Windows HtmlHelp) formats are now supported for the
  user documentation. The HTML documentation is better broken up into
  topics. (Ian Clatworthy)

* The developer and foreign language documents are now separated
  out so that searching in the HTML and CHM files produces more
  useful results. (Ian Clatworthy)

* The main table of contents now provides links to the new Migration Docs
  and Plugins Guide. (Ian Clatworthy)


bzr 2.0.0rc1
############

:Codename: no worries
:2.0.0rc1: 2009-08-26

Compatibility Breaks
********************

* The default format for bzr is now ``2a``. This format brings many
  significant performance and size improvements. bzr can pull from
  any existing repository into a ``2a`` one, but can only transfer
  from ``2a`` into ``rich-root`` repositories. The Upgrade guide
  has more information about this change. (Robert Collins)

* On Windows auto-detection of Putty's plink.exe is disabled.
  Default SSH client for Windows is paramiko. User still can force
  usage of plink if explicitly set environment variable BZR_SSH=plink.
  (#414743, Alexander Belchenko)

New Features
************

* ``bzr branch --switch`` can now switch the checkout in the current directory
  to the newly created branch. (Lukáš Lalinský)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fetches were being requested in 'groupcompress' order, but weren't
  recombining the groups. Thus they would 'fragment' to get the correct
  order, but not 'recombine' to actually benefit from it. Until we get
  recombining to work, switching to 'unordered' fetches avoids the
  fragmentation. (John Arbash Meinel, #402645)

* Fix a pycurl related test failure on karmic by recognizing an error
  raised by newer versions of pycurl.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #306264)

* Fix a test failure on karmic by making a locale test more robust.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #413514)

* Fix IndexError printing CannotBindAddress errors.
  (Martin Pool, #286871)

* Fix "Revision ... not present" errors when upgrading stacked branches,
  or when doing fetches from a stacked source to a stacked target.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #399140)

* ``bzr branch`` of 2a repositories over HTTP is much faster.  bzr now
  batches together small fetches from 2a repositories, rather than
  fetching only a few hundred bytes at a time.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #402657)

Improvements
************

* A better description of the platform is shown in crash tracebacks, ``bzr
  --version`` and ``bzr selftest``.
  (Martin Pool, #409137)

* bzr can now (again) capture crash data through the apport library, 
  so that a single human-readable file can be attached to bug reports.
  This can be disabled by using ``-Dno_apport`` on the command line, or by
  putting ``no_apport`` into the ``debug_flags`` section of
  ``bazaar.conf``.
  (Martin Pool, Robert Collins, #389328)

* ``bzr push`` locally on windows will no longer give a locking error with
  dirstate based formats. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzr shelve`` and ``bzr unshelve`` now work on windows.
  (Robert Collins, #305006)

* Commit of specific files no longer prevents using the the iter_changes
  codepath. On 2a repositories, commit of specific files should now be as
  fast, or slightly faster, than a full commit. (Robert Collins)

* The internal core code that handles specific file operations like
  ``bzr st FILENAME`` or ``bzr commit FILENAME`` has been changed to
  include the parent directories if they have altered, and when a
  directory stops being a directory its children are always included. This
  fixes a number of causes for ``InconsistentDelta`` errors, and permits
  faster commit of specific paths. (Robert Collins, #347649)

Documentation
*************

* New developer documentation for content filtering.
  (Martin Pool)

API Changes
***********

* ``bzrlib.shelf_ui`` has had the ``from_args`` convenience methods of its
  classes changed to manage lock lifetime of the trees they open in a way
  consistent with reader-exclusive locks. (Robert Collins, #305006)

Internals
*********

Testing
*******

bzr 1.18.1
##########

:Codename:     nein nein nein!
:1.18.1:       2009-09-09

This release fixes two small but worthwhile bugs relevant to users on
Microsoft Windows: some commands that failed on with locking errors will
now work, and a bug that caused poor performance after committing a file
with line-ending conversion has now been fixed.  It also fixes a bug in
pushing to older servers.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fixed a problem where using content filtering and especially end-of-line
  conversion will commit too many copies a file.
  (Martin Pool, #415508)

* Fix assertion error about ``_remember_remote_is_before`` in
  ``set_tags_bytes`` when pushing to older smart servers.  
  (Andrew Bennetts, Alexander Belchenko, #418931)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr push`` locally on Windows will no longer give a locking error with
  dirstate based formats. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzr shelve`` and ``bzr unshelve`` now work on Windows.
  (Robert Collins, #305006)

API Changes
***********

* ``bzrlib.shelf_ui`` has had the ``from_args`` convenience methods of its
  classes changed to manage lock lifetime of the trees they open in a way
  consistent with reader-exclusive locks. (Robert Collins, #305006)

* ``Tree.path_content_summary`` may return a size of None, when called on
  a tree with content filtering where the size of the canonical form
  cannot be cheaply determined.  (Martin Pool)


bzr 1.18
########

Compatibility Breaks
********************

* Committing directly to a stacked branch from a lightweight checkout will
  no longer work. In previous versions this would appear to work but would
  generate repositories with insufficient data to create deltas, leading
  to later errors when branching or reading from the repository.
  (Robert Collins, bug #375013)

New Features
************

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fetching from 2a branches from a version-2 bzr protocol would fail to
  copy the internal inventory pages from the CHK store. This cannot happen
  in normal use as all 2a compatible clients and servers support the
  version-3 protocol, but it does cause test suite failures when testing
  downlevel protocol behaviour. (Robert Collins)

* Fix a test failure on karmic by making a locale test more robust.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #413514)

* Fixed "Pack ... already exists" error when running ``bzr pack`` on a
  fully packed 2a repository.  (Andrew Bennetts, #382463)

* Further tweaks to handling of ``bzr add`` messages about ignored files.
  (Jason Spashett, #76616)

* Properly handle fetching into a stacked branch while converting the
  data, especially when there are also ghosts. The code was filling in
  parent inventories incorrectly, and also not handling when one of the
  parents was a ghost. (John Arbash Meinel, #402778, #412198)

* ``RemoteStreamSource.get_stream_for_missing_keys`` will fetch CHK
  inventory pages when appropriate (by falling back to the vfs stream
  source).  (Andrew Bennetts, #406686)

* StreamSource generates rich roots from non-rich root sources correctly
  now.  (Andrew Bennetts, #368921)

* When deciding whether a repository was compatible for upgrading or
  fetching, we previously incorrectly checked the default repository
  format for the bzrdir format, rather than the format that was actually
  present on disk.  (Martin Pool, #408824)

Improvements
************

* A better description of the platform is shown in crash tracebacks, ``bzr
  --version`` and ``bzr selftest``.
  (Martin Pool, #409137)

* Cross-format fetches (such as between 1.9-rich-root and 2a) via the
  smart server are more efficient now.  They send inventory deltas rather
  than full inventories.  The smart server has two new requests,
  ``Repository.get_stream_1.19`` and ``Repository.insert_stream_1.19`` to
  support this.  (Andrew Bennetts, #374738, #385826)

* Extracting the full ancestry and computing the ``merge_sort`` is now
  significantly faster. This effects things like ``bzr log -n0``. (For
  example, ``bzr log -r -10..-1 -n0 bzr.dev`` is 2.5s down to 1.0s.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

Documentation
*************

API Changes
***********

Internals
*********

* ``-Dstrict_locks`` can now be used to check that read and write locks
  are treated properly w.r.t. exclusivity. (We don't try to take an OS
  read lock on a file that we already have an OS write lock on.) This is
  now set by default for all tests, if you have a test which cannot be
  fixed, you can use ``self.thisFailsStrictLockCheck()`` as a
  compatibility knob. (John Arbash Meinel)

* InterDifferingSerializer is now only used locally.  Other fetches that
  would have used InterDifferingSerializer now use the more network
  friendly StreamSource, which now automatically does the same
  transformations as InterDifferingSerializer.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``KnownGraph`` now has a ``.topo_sort`` and ``.merge_sort`` member which
  are implemented in pyrex and significantly faster. This is exposed along
  with ``CombinedGraphIndex.find_ancestry()`` as
  ``VersionedFiles.get_known_graph_ancestry(keys)``.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* RemoteBranch.open now honours ignore_fallbacks correctly on bzr-v2
  protocols. (Robert Collins)

* The index code now has some specialized routines to extract the full
  ancestry of a key in a more efficient manner.
  ``CombinedGraphIndex.find_ancestry()``. (Time to get ancestry for
  bzr.dev drops from 1.5s down to 300ms. For OOo from 33s => 10.5s) (John
  Arbash Meinel)

Testing
*******

* Install the test ssl certificate and key so that installed bzr
  can run the https tests. (Denys Duchier, #392401)
  

bzr 1.18rc1
###########

:Codename: little traveller
:1.18:    2009-08-20
:1.18rc1: 2009-08-10

This release of Bazaar marches on towards the 2.0 release in which the 2a
'brisbane-core' format becomes generally recommended.  Most of the work in
this release now focusses on bug fixes and stabilization, covering both 2a
and previous formats.  There is a new text-mode interactive merge feature,
a new guide to migration to 2a format in the user documentation, and
pushing branches to a smart server is now much faster.  

The Bazaar team decided that 2.0 will be a long-term supported release,
with bugfix-only releases based on it continuing for at least six months
or until the following stable release.

There are no changes from 1.18rc1 to 1.18.

New Features
************

* ``bzr merge --interactive`` applies a user-selected portion of the
  merge.  The UI is similar to ``shelve``.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr reconfigure`` now takes options ``--stacked-on URL`` and
  ``--unstacked`` to change stacking of a branch.
  (Martin Pool, #391411)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Annotating on a stacked branch will now succeed in simple scenarios.
  There are still some complex scenarios where it will fail (bug #399884)
  (John Arbash Meinel, #393366)

* A progress bar is no longer left dangling when ``bzr selftest``
  completes, and the progress bar updates with zero latency so the
  displayed test name is always the one that's actually running.
  (Martin Pool, #123688)

* Authenticating against an ssh server now uses ``auth_none`` to determine
  if password authentication is even supported. This fixes a bug where
  users would be prompted for a launchpad password, even though launchpad
  only supports publickey authentication. (John Arbash Meinel, #375867)

* BranchBuilder now accepts timezone to avoid test failures in countries far
  from GMT. (Vincent Ladeuil, #397716)

* ``bzr commit`` no longer saves the unversioning of missing files until
  the commit has completed on the branch. This means that aborting a
  commit that found a missing file will leave the tree unedited.
  (Robert Collins, #282402)

* ``bzr mv`` no longer takes out branch locks, which allows it to work
  when the branch is readonly. (Robert Collins, #216541)

* ``bzr revert .`` no longer generates an InconsistentDelta error when
  there are missing subtrees. (Robert Collins, #367632)

* ``bzr send`` now generates valid bundles with ``--2a`` formats. However,
  do to internal changes necessary to support this, older clients will
  fail when trying to insert them. For newer clients, the bundle can be
  used to apply the changes to any rich-root compatible format.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #393349)

* Cope with FTP servers that don't support restart/append by falling back
  to reading and then rewriting the whole file, such as TahoeLAFS.  (This
  fallback may be slow for some access patterns.)  (Nils Durner, #294709)

* Encode the paths in ``mbcs`` encoding on Windows when spawning an
  external diff client. This at least allows supporting filenames that are
  not ascii, but are present in the current locale. Ideally we would be
  able to pass the Unicode path, but that would be client dependent.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #382709)

* Fix a compile bug on Solaris having to do with const and
  pointer-to-pointers. (John Arbash Meinel, #408441)

* Fixed a NameError that occurs when merging or pulling from a URL that
  causes a redirection loop when bzr tries to read a URL as a bundle.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #400847)

* Fix ``AttributeError: 'TestUIFactory' object has no attribute 'tick'``
  running send and similar commands on 2a formats.
  (Martin Pool, #408201)
  
* Fix crash in some invocations of ``bzr status`` in format 2a.
  (Martin Pool, #403523)

* Fixed export to existing directory: if directory is empty then export 
  will succeed, otherwise it fails with error.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #406174)

* Fixed spurious "Source branch does not support stacking" warning when
  pushing. (Andrew Bennetts, #388908)

* Fixed spurious transport activity indicator appearing while tests are
  running.  (Martin Pool, #343532)

* Merge now correctly handles empty right-hand revision specs.
  (Aaron Bentley, #333961)

* Renames to lexographically lower basenames in trees that have never been
  committed to will no longer corrupt the dirstate. This was caused by an
  bug in the dirstate update_minimal method. (Robert Collins, #395556)

* Requests for unknown methods no longer cause the smart server to log
  lots of backtraces about ``UnknownSmartMethod``, ``do_chunk`` or
  ``do_end``.  (Andrew Bennetts, #338561)

* Shelve will not shelve the initial add of the tree root.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Streaming from bzr servers where there is a chain of stacked branches
  (A stacked on B stacked on C) will now work. (Robert Collins, #406597)

* The environment variable ``BZR_PROGRESS_BAR`` set to either ``text`` or ``none``
  always forces progress bars either on or off respectively.  Otherwise,
  they're turned on if ``TERM`` is not ``dumb`` and stderr is a terminal.
  bzr always uses the 'text' user interface when run as a command, so
  ``BZR_USE_TEXT_UI`` is no longer needed.
  (Martin Pool, #339385, #387717)

* The optional ``_knit_load_data_pyx`` C extension was never being
  imported.  This caused significant slowdowns when reading data from
  repositories.  (Andrew Bennetts, #405653)
  
* The ``--hardlink`` option to ``branch`` and ``checkout`` is not
  supported at the moment on workingtree formats that can do content
  filtering.  (See <https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/bzr/+bug/408193>.)
  bzr now says so, rather than just ignoring the option.  (Martin Pool)

* There was a bug in ``osutils.relpath`` that was only triggered on
  Windows. Essentially if you were at the root of a drive, and did
  something to a branch/repo on another drive, we would go into an
  infinite loop while trying to find a 'relative path'.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #394227)

* ``WorkingTree4.unversion`` will no longer fail to unversion ids which
  were present in a parent tree but renamed in the working tree.
  (Robert Collins, #187207)

Improvements
************

* Can now rename/move files even if they have been removed from the inventory.
  (Marius Kruger)

* Pushing branches with tags via ``bzr://`` and ``bzr+ssh://`` is much
  faster, using a new ``Branch.set_tags_bytes`` smart server verb rather
  than VFS methods.  For example, pushes of small branches with tags take
  11 rather than 18 smart server requests.  (Andrew Bennetts, #398608)

* Sending Ctrl-Break on Windows will now drop you into the debugger, in
  the same way that sending Ctrl-\\ does on other platforms.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

Documentation
*************

* Added Bazaar 2.0 Upgrade Guide. (Ian Clatworthy)

API Changes
***********

* ``CLIUIFactory`` is deprecated; use ``TextUIFactory`` instead if you
  need to subclass or create a specific class, or better yet the existing
  ``make_ui_for_terminal``.  ``SilentUIFactory`` is clarified to do no
  user interaction at all, rather than trying to read from stdin but not
  writing any output, which would be strange if reading prompts or
  passwords.  (Martin Pool)

* New TransformPreview.commit() allows committing without a working tree.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``pb`` parameter to ``TextTestResult`` is deprecated and ignored.
  (Martin Pool)

* ProgressTasks now prefer to talk direct to their ProgressView not to the
  UIFactory. 
  (Martin Pool)

* ``WorkingTree._check`` now requires a references dict with keys matching
  those returned by ``WorkingTree._get_check_refs``. (Robert Collins)

Internals
*********

* ``CHKInventory.path2id`` uses the parent_id to basename hash to avoid
  reading the entries along the path, reducing work to lookup ids from
  paths. (Robert Collins)

* ``CHKMap.apply_delta`` now raises ``InconsistentDelta`` if a delta adds
  as new a key which was already mapped. (Robert Collins)

* Inventory delta application catches more cases of corruption and can
  prevent corrupt deltas from affecting consistency of data structures on
  disk. (Robert Collins)

* --subunit support now adds timestamps if the subunit version supports
  it. (Robert Collins)

* The Windows all-in-one installer now bundles the PyQt image format
  plugins, which allows previewing more images as part of 'qdiff'.
  (Alexander Belchenko)


Testing
*******

* Merge directive cherrypick tests must use the same root id.
  (Martin Pool, #409684)

* Spurious failure in ``check`` tests on rich-root formats fixed.
  (Martin Pool, #408199)

* The ``bzrlib.tests.TextTestRunner`` will no longer call
  ``countTestsCases`` on the test being run. Progress information is
  instead handled by having the test passed in call ``result.progress``
  before running its contents. This improves the behaviour when using
  ``TextTestRunner`` with test suites that don't support
  ``countTestsCases``. (Robert Collins)


bzr 1.17
########
:Codename: so-late-its-brunch
:1.17rc1: 2009-07-13
:1.17: 2009-07-20


Bazaar continues to blaze a straight and shining path to the 2.0 release and
the elevation of the ``2a`` beta format to the full glory of "supported and
stable".

Highlights in this release include greatly reduced memory consumption during
commits, faster ``ls``, faster ``annotate``, faster network operations if
you're specifying a revision number and the final destruction of those
annoying progress bar artifacts.


Changes from 1.17rc1 to 1.17final
*********************************

* Change an extension to call the python ``frozenset()`` rather than the C
  api ``PyFrozenSet_New``. It turns out that python2.4 did not expose the
  C api. (John Arbash Meinel, #399366)

* Fixes for the Makefile and the rename of ``generate_docs.py`` to
  ``tools/generate_docs.py`` to allow everything to be built on Windows.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #399356)

* ``bzr serve`` once again applies a ``ChrootServer`` to the given
  directory before serving it. (Andrew Bennetts, #400535)


Compatibility Breaks
********************

* ``bzr register-branch`` from the Launchpad plugin now refers to "project"
  instead of "product" which is the correct Launchpad terminology.  The
  --product option is deprecated and users should switch to using --project.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #238764)


New Features
************

* ``bzr push`` now aborts if uncommitted changes (including pending merges)
  are present in the working tree (if one is present) and no revision is
  specified. The configuration option ``push_strict`` can be used to set the
  default for this behavior.  (Vincent Ladeuil, #284038, #322808, #65286)

* ``bzr revno`` and ``bzr revision-info`` now have a ``--tree`` option to
  show revision info for the working tree instead of the branch.
  (Matthew Fuller, John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr send`` now aborts if uncommitted changes (including pending merges)
  are present in the working tree and no revision is specified. The
  configuration option ``send_strict`` can be used to set the default for this
  behavior.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #206577)

* ``bzr switch --create-branch/-b`` can now be used to create and switch
  to a new branch. Supplying a name without a ``/`` will create the branch
  relative to the existing branch. (similar to how ``bzr switch name``
  works when the branch already exists.) (John Arbash Meinel)


Bug Fixes
*********

* Accept uppercase "Y/N" to prompts such as from break lock. 
  (#335182, Tim Powell, Martin Pool)

* Add documentation about diverged branches and how to fix them in the
  centralized workflow with local commits.  Mention ``bzr help
  diverged-branches`` when a push fails because the branches have
  diverged.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #269477)

* Annotate would sometimes 'latch on' to trivial lines, causing important
  lines to be incorrectly annotated. (John Arbash Meinel, #387952)

* Automatic format upgrades triggered by default stacking policies on a
  1.16rc1 (or later) smart server work again.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #388675)

* Avoid progress bar artifacts being left behind on the screen.
  (Martin Pool, #321935)

* Better message in ``bzr split`` error suggesting a rich root format.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #220067)

* ``Branch.set_append_revisions_only`` now works with branches on a smart
  server. (Andrew Bennetts, #365865)

* By default, ``bzr branch`` will fail if the target directory exists, but
  does not already have a control directory.  The flag ``--use-existing-dir``
  will allow operation to proceed.  (Alexander Belchenko, #307554)

* ``bzr ls DIR --from-root`` now shows only things in DIR, not everything.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Fetch between repositories does not error if they have inconsistent data
  that should be irrelevant to the fetch operation. (Aaron Bentley)

* Fix ``AttributeError`` exception when reconfiguring lightweight checkout 
  of a remote repository.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #332194)

* Fix bug in decoding v3 smart server messages when receiving multiple
  lots of excess bytes after an end-of-message.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Force deletion of readonly files during merge, update and other tree
  transforms.
  (Craig Hewetson, Martin Pool, #218206)

* Force socket shutdown in threaded http test servers to avoid client hangs
  (pycurl).  (Vincent Ladeuil, #383920).

* ``LRUCache`` will maintain the linked list pointers even if a nodes
  cleanup function raises an exception. (John Arbash Meinel, #396838)

* Progress bars are now suppressed again when the environment variable
  ``BZR_PROGRESS_BAR`` is set to ``none``.
  (Martin Pool, #339385)

* Reduced memory consumption during ``bzr commit`` of large files. For
  pre 2a formats, should be down to ~3x the size of a file.
  For ``--2a`` format repositories, it is down to the size of the file
  content plus the size of the compressed text.  Related to bug #109114.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Set hidden attribute on .bzr directory below unicode path should never
  fail with error. The operation should succeed even if bzr unable to set 
  the attribute.  (Alexander Belchenko, related to bug #335362).
  
* Stacking will no longer accept requests to stack on the same
  branch/repository. Existing branches that incorrectly reference the same
  repository in a stacking configuration will now raise
  UnstackableLocationError when the branch is opened. This can be fixed by
  removing the stacking location inside ``.bzr/branch``.
  (Robert Collins, #376243)

* The ``log+`` decorator, useful in debugging or profiling, could cause
  "AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'next'".  This is now
  fixed.  The log decorator no longer shows the elapsed time or transfer
  rate because they're available in the log prefixes and the transport
  activity display respectively.
  (Martin Pool, #340347)

* Unshelve works correctly when multiple zero-length files are present on
  the shelf. (Aaron Bentley, #363444)

* Progress bars no longer show the network transport scheme or direction.
  (Martin Pool)

* launchpad-login now respects the 'verbose' option.
  (Jonathan Lange, #217031)


Internals
*********

* ``bzrlib.user_encoding`` is now officially deprecated. It is not
  possible to write a deprecation wrapper, but the variable will be
  removed in the near future. Use ``bzrlib.osutils.get_user_encoding()``
  instead. (Alexander Belchenko)

* Command lookup has had hooks added. ``bzrlib.Command.hooks`` has
  three new hook points: ``get_command``, ``get_missing_command`` and
  ``list_commands``, which allow just-in-time command name provision
  rather than requiring all command names be known a-priori.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``get_app_path`` from win32utils.py now supports REG_EXPAND_SZ data type
  and can read path to wordpad.exe. (Alexander Belchenko, #392046)

* ``graph.KnownGraph`` has been added. This is a class that can give
  answers to ``heads()`` very quickly. However, it has the assumption that
  the whole graph has already been loaded. This is true during
  ``annotate`` so it is used there with good success (as much as 2x faster
  for files with long ancestry and 'cherrypicked' changes.)
  (John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil)

* OS file locks are now taken out using ``CreateFile`` rather than
  ``LockFileEx`` on Windows. The locking remains exclusive with
  ``LockFileEx`` but now it also works on older versions of Windows (such
  as Win98). (Martin <gzlist>)

* pack <=> pack fetching is now done via a ``PackStreamSource`` rather
  than the ``Packer`` code. The user visible change is that we now
  properly fetch the minimum number of texts for non-smart fetching.
  (John Arbash Meinel)


* ``VersionedFiles._add_text`` is a new api that lets us insert text into
  the repository as a single string, rather than a list of lines. This can
  improve memory overhead and performance of committing large files.
  (Currently a private api, used only by commit). (John Arbash Meinel)


Improvements
************

* ``bzr annotate`` can now be significantly faster. The time for
  ``bzr annotate NEWS`` is down to 7s from 22s in 1.16. Files with long
  histories and lots of 'duplicate insertions' will be improved more than
  others. (John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``bzr ls`` is now faster. On OpenOffice.org, the time drops from 2.4
  to 1.1 seconds. The improvement for ``bzr ls -r-1`` is more
  substantial dropping from 54.3 to 1.1 seconds. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Improve "Path(s) are not versioned" error reporting for some commands.
  (Benoît PIERRE)

* Initial commit performance in ``--2a`` repositories has been improved by
  making it cheaper to build the initial CHKMap. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Resolving a revno to a revision id on a branch accessed via ``bzr://``
  or ``bzr+ssh://`` is now much faster and involves no VFS operations.
  This speeds up commands like ``bzr pull -r 123``.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``revision-info`` now properly aligns the revnos/revids in the output
  and doesn't traceback when given revisions not in the current branch.
  Performance is also significantly improved when requesting multiple revs
  at once.  (Matthew Fuller, John Arbash Meinel)

* Tildes are no longer escaped by Transports. (Andy Kilner)


Documentation
*************

* Avoid bad text wrapping in generated documentation.  Slightly better
  formatting in the user reference.
  (Martin Pool, #249908)

* Minor clarifications to the help for End-Of-Line conversions.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

API Changes
***********

* Removed overspecific error class ``InvalidProgressBarType``.
  (Martin Pool)

* The method ``ProgressView._show_transport_activity`` is now
  ``show_transport_activity`` because it's part of the contract between
  this class and the UI.  (Martin Pool)


bzr 1.16.1
##########

:Released: 2009-06-26

End user testing of the 2a format revealed two serious bugs. The first,
#365615, caused bzr to raise AbsentContentFactory errors when autopacking.
This meant that commits or pushes to 2a-format repositories failed
intermittently.

The second bug, #390563, caused the smart server to raise AbsentContentFactory
when streaming 2a stacked 2a-format branches. This particularly affected
branches stored on Launchpad in the 2a format.

Both of these bugs cause command failures only, neither of them cause data
corruption or data loss. And, of course, both of these bugs are now fixed.

Bug Fixes
*********

* We now properly request a more minimal set of file texts when fetching
  multiple revisions. (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel, #390563)

* Repositories using CHK pages (which includes the new 2a format) will no
  longer error during commit or push operations when an autopack operation
  is triggered. (Robert Collins, #365615)

* ``chk_map.iter_interesting_nodes`` now properly uses the *intersection*
  of referenced nodes rather than the *union* to determine what
  uninteresting pages we still need to look at. Prior to this,
  incrementally pushing to stacked branch would push the minimal data, but
  fetching everything would request extra texts. There are some unhandled
  cases wrt trees of different depths, but this fixes the common cases.
  (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel, #390563)

* ``GroupCompress`` repositories now take advantage of the pack hints
  parameter to permit cross-format fetching to incrementally pack the
  converted data. (Robert Collins)

* ``Repository.commit_write_group`` now returns opaque data about what
  was committed, for passing to the ``Repository.pack``. Repositories
  without atomic commits will still return None. (Robert Collins)

* ``Repository.pack`` now takes an optional ``hint`` parameter
  which will support doing partial packs for repositories that can do
  that. (Robert Collins)

* RepositoryFormat has a new attribute 'pack_compresses' which is True
  when doing a pack operation changes the compression of content in the
  repository. (Robert Collins)

* ``StreamSink`` and ``InterDifferingSerialiser`` will call
  ``Repository.pack`` with the hint returned by
  ``Repository.commit_write_group`` if the formats were different and the
  repository can increase compression by doing a pack operation.
  (Robert Collins, #376748)


bzr 1.16
########
:Codename: yesterday-in-california
:1.16rc1: 2009-06-11
:1.16: 2009-06-18

This version of Bazaar contains the beta release of the new ``2a`` repository
format, suitable for testing by fearless, advanced users. This format or an
updated version of it will become the default format in Bazaar 2.0. Please
read the NEWS entry before even thinking about upgrading to the new format.

Also included are speedups for many operations on huge projects, a bug fix for
pushing stacked new stacked branches to smart servers and the usual bevy of
bug fixes and improvements.


Changes from 1.16rc1 to 1.16final
*********************************

* Fix the nested tree flag check so that upgrade from development formats to
  2a can work correctly.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #388727)

* Automatic format upgrades triggered by default stacking policies on a
  1.16rc1 (or later) smart server work again.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #388675)


Compatibility Breaks
********************

* Display prompt on stderr (instead of stdout) when querying users so
  that the output of commands can be safely redirected.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #376582)


New Features
************

* A new repository format ``2a`` has been added.  This is a beta release
  of the the brisbane-core (aka group-compress) project.  This format now
  suitable for wider testing by advanced users willing to deal with some
  bugs.  We would appreciate test reports, either positive or negative.
  Format 2a is substantially smaller and faster for many operations on
  many trees.  This format or an updated version will become the default
  in bzr 2.0.

  This is a rich-root format, so this repository format can be used with
  bzr-svn.  Bazaar branches in previous non-rich-root formats can be
  converted (including by merge, push and pull) to format 2a, but not vice
  versa.  We recommend upgrading previous development formats to 2a.

  Upgrading to this format can take considerable time because it expands
  and more concisely repacks the full history.

  If you use stacked branches, you must upgrade the stacked branches
  before the stacked-on branches.  (See <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/374735>)

* ``--development7-rich-root`` is a new dev format, similar to ``--dev6``
  but using a Revision serializer using bencode rather than XML.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, John Arbash Meinel)

* mail_client=claws now supports --body (and message body hooks).  Also uses
  configured from address.  (Barry Warsaw)

Improvements
************


* ``--development6-rich-root`` can now stack. (Modulo some smart-server
  bugs with stacking and non default formats.)
  (John Arbash Meinel, #373455)

* ``--development6-rich-root`` delays generating a delta index for the
  first object inserted into a group. This has a beneficial impact on
  ``bzr commit`` since each committed texts goes to its own group. For
  committing a 90MB file, it drops peak memory by about 200MB, and speeds
  up commit from 7s => 4s. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Numerous operations are now faster for huge projects, i.e. those
  with a large number of files and/or a large number of revisions,
  particularly when the latest development format is used. These
  operations (and improvements on OpenOffice.org) include:

  * branch in a shared repository (2X faster)
  * branch --no-tree (100X faster)
  * diff (2X faster)
  * tags (70X faster)

  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Pyrex version of ``bencode`` support. This provides optimized support
  for both encoding and decoding, and is now found at ``bzrlib.bencode``.
  ``bzrlib.utils.bencode`` is now deprecated.
  (Alexander Belchenko, Jelmer Vernooij, John Arbash Meinel)


Bug Fixes
*********

* Bazaar can now pass attachment files to the mutt email client.
  (Edwin Grubbs, #384158)

* Better message in ``bzr add`` output suggesting using ``bzr ignored`` to
  see which files can also be added.  (Jason Spashett, #76616)

* ``bzr pull -r 123`` from a stacked branch on a smart server no longer fails.
  Also, the ``Branch.revision_history()`` API now works in the same
  situation.  (Andrew Bennetts, #380314)
  
* ``bzr serve`` on Windows no longer displays a traceback simply because a
  TCP client disconnected. (Andrew Bennetts)

* Clarify the rules for locking and fallback repositories. Fix bugs in how
  ``RemoteRepository`` was handling fallbacks along with the
  ``_real_repository``. (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel, #375496)

* Fix a small bug with fetching revisions w/ ghosts into a new stacked
  branch. Not often triggered, because it required ghosts to be part of
  the fetched revisions, not in the stacked-on ancestry.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Fix status and commit to work with content filtered trees, addressing
  numerous bad bugs with line-ending support. (Ian Clatworthy, #362030)

* Fix problem of "directory not empty" when contending for a lock over
  sftp.  (Martin Pool, #340352)

* Fix rule handling so that eol is optional, not mandatory.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #379370)

* Pushing a new stacked branch to a 1.15 smart server was broken due to a
  bug in the ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex`` smart verb.  This is fixed in
  1.16, but required changes to the network protocol, so the
  ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex`` verb has been removed and replaced with a
  corrected ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex_1.16`` verb.  1.15 clients will
  still work with a 1.16 server as they will fallback to slower (and
  bug-free) methods.
  (Jonathan Lange, Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts, #385132)

* Reconcile can now deal with text revisions that originated in revisions 
  that are ghosts. (Jelmer Vernooij, #336749)

* Support cloning of branches with ghosts in the left hand side history.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #248540)

* The ''bzr diff'' now catches OSError from osutils.rmtree and logs a
  helpful message to the trace file, unless the temp directory really was
  removed (which would be very strange).  Since the diff operation has
  succeeded from the user's perspective, no output is written to stderr 
  or stdout.  (Maritza Mendez, #363837)

* Translate errors received from a smart server in response to a
  ``BzrDirFormat.initialize`` or ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex`` request.
  This was causing tracebacks even for mundane errors like
  ``PermissionDenied``.  (Andrew Bennetts, #381329)

Documentation
*************

* Added directory structure and started translation of docs in Russian.
  (Alexey Shtokalo, Alexander Iljin, Alexander Belchenko, Dmitry Vasiliev,
  Volodymyr Kotulskyi)

API Changes
***********

* Added osutils.parent_directories(). (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzrlib.progress.ProgressBar``, ``ChildProgress``, ``DotsProgressBar``,
  ``TTYProgressBar`` and ``child_progress`` are now deprecated; use
  ``ui_factory.nested_progress_bar`` instead.  (Martin Pool)

* ``graph.StackedParentsProvider`` is now a public API, replacing
  ``graph._StackedParentsProvider``. The api is now considered stable and ready
  for external users. (Gary van der Merwe)

* ``bzrlib.user_encoding`` is deprecated in favor of
  ``get_user_encoding``.  (Alexander Belchenko)

* TreeTransformBase no longer assumes that limbo is provided via disk.
  DiskTreeTransform now provides disk functionality.  (Aaron Bentley)

Internals
*********

* Remove ``weave.py`` script for accessing internals of old weave-format
  repositories.  (Martin Pool)

Testing
*******

* The number of cores is now correctly detected on OSX. (John Szakmeister)

* The number of cores is also detected on Solaris and win32. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* The number of cores is also detected on FreeBSD. (Matthew Fuller)


bzr 1.15
########
:1.15rc1: 2009-05-16
:1.15: 2009-05-22
:1.15.1: 2009-06-09

The smart server will no longer raise 'NoSuchRevision' when streaming content
with a size mismatch in a reconstructed graph search. New command ``bzr
dpush``. Plugins can now define their own annotation tie-breaker when two
revisions introduce the exact same line.

Changes from 1.15.1 to 1.15.2
*****************************

* Use zdll on Windows to build ``_chk_map_pyx`` extension.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

Changes from 1.15final to 1.15.1
*********************************

* Translate errors received from a smart server in response to a
  ``BzrDirFormat.initialize`` or ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex`` request.
  This was causing tracebacks even for mundane errors like
  ``PermissionDenied``.  (Andrew Bennetts, #381329)

Changes from 1.15rc1 to 1.15final
*********************************

* No changes

Compatibility Breaks
********************

* ``bzr ls`` is no longer recursive by default. To recurse, use the
  new ``-R`` option. The old ``--non-recursive`` option has been removed.
  If you alias ``ls`` to ``ls -R``, you can disable recursion using
  ``--no-recursive`` instead.  (Ian Clatworthy)

New Features
************

* New command ``bzr dpush`` that can push changes to foreign 
  branches (svn, git) without setting custom bzr-specific metadata.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* The new development format ``--development6-rich-root`` now supports
  stacking. We chose not to use a new format marker, since old clients
  will just fail to open stacked branches, the same as if we used a new
  format flag. (John Arbash Meinel, #373455)

* Plugins can now define their own annotation tie-breaker when two revisions
  introduce the exact same line. See ``bzrlib.annotate._break_annotation_tie``
  Be aware though that this is temporary, private (as indicated by the leading
  '_') and a first step to address the problem. (Vincent Ladeuil, #348459)

* New command ``bzr dpush`` that can push changes to foreign 
  branches (svn, git) without setting custom bzr-specific metadata.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``bzr send`` will now check the ``child_submit_format`` setting in
  the submit branch to determine what format to use, if none was 
  specified on the command-line.  (Jelmer Vernooij)

Improvements
************

* -Dhpss output now includes the number of VFS calls made to the remote
  server. (Jonathan Lange)

* ``--coverage`` works for code running in threads too.
  (Andrew Bennets, Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``bzr pull`` now has a ``--local`` option to only make changes to the
  local branch, and not the bound master branch.
  (Gary van der Merwe, #194716)

* ``bzr rm *`` is now as fast as ``bzr rm * --keep``. (Johan Walles, #180116)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Adding now works properly when path contains a symbolic link.
  (Geoff Bache, #183831)

* An error is now raised for unknown eol values. (Brian de Alwis, #358199)

* ``bzr merge --weave`` will now generate a conflict if one side deletes a
  line, and the other side modifies the line. (John Arbash Meinel, #328171)

* ``bzr reconfigure --standalone`` no longer raises IncompatibleRepositories.
  (Martin von Gagern, #248932)

* ``bzr send`` works to send emails again using MAPI.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #346998)

* Check for missing parent inventories in StreamSink.  This prevents
  incomplete stacked branches being created by 1.13 bzr:// and
  bzr+ssh:// clients (which have bug #354036).  Instead, the server now
  causes those clients to send the missing records.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Correctly handle http servers proposing multiple authentication schemes.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #366107)

* End-Of-Line content filters are now loaded correctly.
  (Ian Clatworthy, Brian de Alwis, #355280)

* Fix a bug in the pure-python ``GroupCompress`` code when handling copies
  longer than 64KiB. (John Arbash Meinel, #364900)

* Fix TypeError in running ``bzr break-lock`` on some URLs.
  (Alexander Belchenko, Martin Pool, #365891)

* Non-recursive ``bzr ls`` now works properly when a path is specified.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #357863)

* ssh usernames (defined in ~/.ssh/config) are honoured for bzr+ssh connections.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #367726)

* Several bugs related to unicode symlinks have been fixed and the test suite
  enhanced to better catch regressions for them. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* The smart server will no longer raise 'NoSuchRevision' when streaming
  content with a size mismatch in a reconstructed graph search: it assumes
  that the client will make sure it is happy with what it got, and this
  sort of mismatch is normal for stacked environments.
  bzr 1.13.0/1 will stream from unstacked branches only - in that case not
  getting all the content expected would be a bug. However the graph
  search is how we figured out what we wanted, so a mismatch is both odd
  and unrecoverable without starting over, and starting over will end up
  with the same data as if we just permitted the mismatch. If data is
  gc'd, doing a new search will find only the truncated data, so sending
  only the truncated data seems reasonable. bzr versions newer than this
  will stream from stacked branches and check the stream to find missing
  content in the stacked-on branch, and thus will handle the situation
  implicitly.  (Robert Collins, #360791)

* Upgrading to, or fetching into a 'rich-root' format will now correctly
  set the root data the same way that reconcile does.
  (Robert Collins, #368921)

* Using unicode Windows API to obtain command-line arguments.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #375934)

Documentation
*************

API Changes
***********

* ``InterPackRepo.fetch`` and ``RepoFetcher`` now raise ``NoSuchRevision``
  instead of ``InstallFailed`` when they detect a missing revision.
  ``InstallFailed`` itself has been deleted. (Jonathan Lange)

* Not passing arguments to ``bzrlib.commands.main()`` will now grab the
  arguments from ``osutils.get_unicode_argv()`` which has proper support
  for unicode arguments on windows. Further, the supplied arguments are now 
  required to be unicode strings, rather than user_encoded strings.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

Internals
*********

* ``bzrlib.branch.Branch.set_parent`` is now present on the base branch
  class and will call ``_set_parent_location`` after doing unicode 
  encoding. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.remote.RemoteBranch._set_parent_location`` will use a new verb
  ``Branch.set_parent_location`` removing further VFS operations.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.bzrdir.BzrDir._get_config`` now returns a ``TransportConfig``
  or similar when the dir supports configuration settings. The base class
  defaults to None. There is a matching new server verb
  ``BzrDir.get-config_file`` to reduce roundtrips for getting BzrDir
  configuration. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.tests.ExtendedTestResult`` has new methods ``startTests``
  called before the first test is started, ``done`` called after the last
  test completes, and a new parameter ``strict``. (Robert Collins)

* ``-Dhpss`` when passed to bzr will cause a backtrace to be printed when
  VFS operations are started on a smart server repository. This should not
  occur on regular push and pull operations, and is a key indicator for
  performance regressions. (Robert Collins)

* ``-Dlock`` when passed to the selftest (e.g. ``bzr -Dlock selftest``) will
  cause mismatched physical locks to cause test errors rather than just
  reporting to the screen. (Robert Collins)

* -Dprogress will cause pdb to start up if a progress view jumps
  backwards. (Robert Collins)

* Fallback ``CredentialStore`` instances registered with ``fallback=True``
  are now be able to provide credentials if obtaining credentials 
  via ~/.bazaar/authentication.conf fails. (Jelmer Vernooij, 
  Vincent Ladeuil, #321918)

* New hook ``Lock.lock_broken`` which runs when a lock is
  broken. This is mainly for testing that lock/unlock are
  balanced in tests. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* New MergeDirective hook 'merge_request_body' allows hooks to supply or
  alter a body for the message produced by ``bzr send``.

* New smart server verb ``BzrDir.initialize_ex`` which implements a
  refactoring to the core of clone allowing less round trips on new
  branches. (Robert Collins)

* New method ``Tags.rename_revisions`` that can rename revision ids tags
  are pointing at. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Updated the bundled ``ConfigObj`` library to 4.6.0 (Matt Nordhoff)

Testing
*******

* ``bzr selftest`` will now fail if lock/unlock are not correctly balanced in
  tests. Using ``-Dlock`` will turn the related failures into warnings.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, Robert Collins)

bzr 1.14
########
:Codename: brisbane-core
:1.14rc1: 2009-04-06
:1.14rc2: 2009-04-19
:1.14: 2009-04-28
:1.14.1: 2009-05-01

New formats 1.14 and 1.14-rich-root supporting End-Of-Line (EOL) conversions,
keyword templating (via the bzr-keywords plugin) and generic content filtering.
End-of-line conversion is now supported for formats supporting content
filtering.

Changes from 1.14final to 1.14.1
********************************

* Change api_minimum_version back to api_minimum_version = (1, 13, 0)

Changes from 1.14rc2 to 1.14final
*********************************

* Fix a bug in the pure-python ``GroupCompress`` code when handling copies
  longer than 64KiB. (John Arbash Meinel, #364900)

Changes from 1.14rc1 to 1.14rc2
*******************************

* Fix for bug 358037 Revision not in
  bzrlib.groupcompress.GroupCompressVersionedFiles (Brian de Alwis, 
  John A Meinel)

* Fix for bug 354036 ErrorFromSmartServer - AbsentContentFactory object has no
  attribute 'get_bytes_as' exception while pulling from Launchpad 
  (Jean-Francois Roy, Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* Fix for bug 355280 eol content filters are never loaded and thus never
  applied (Brian de Alwis, Ian Clatworthy)
 
* bzr.dev -r4280  Change _fetch_uses_deltas = False for CHK repos until we can
  write a better fix. (John Arbash Meinel, Robert Collins)

* Fix for bug 361574 uncommit recommends undefined --levels and -n options
  (Marius Kruger, Ian Clatworthy)

* bzr.dev r4289 as cherrypicked at lp:~spiv/bzr/stacking-cherrypick-1.14 
  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

Compatibility Breaks
********************

* A previously disabled code path to accelerate getting configuration
  settings from a smart server has been reinstated. We think this *may*
  cause a incompatibility with servers older than bzr 0.15. We intend
  to issue a point release to address this if it turns out to be a
  problem. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* bzr no longer autodetects nested trees as 'tree-references'.  They
  must now be explicitly added tree references.  At the commandline, use
  join --reference instead of add.  (Aaron Bentley)

* The ``--long`` log format (the default) no longer shows merged
  revisions implicitly, making it consistent with the ``short`` and
  ``line`` log formats.  To see merged revisions for just a given
  revision, use ``bzr log -n0 -rX``. To see every merged revision,
  use ``bzr log -n0``.  (Ian Clatworthy)

New Features
************

* New formats ``1.14`` and ``1.14-rich-root`` supporting End-Of-Line
  (EOL) conversions, keyword templating (via the bzr-keywords plugin)
  and generic content filtering. These formats replace the experimental
  ``development-wt5`` and ``development-wt5-rich-root`` formats
  respectively, but have support for filtered views disabled.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* New ``mv --auto`` option recognizes renames after they occur.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr`` can now get passwords from stdin without requiring a controlling
  terminal (i.e. by redirecting stdin). (Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``bzr log`` now supports filtering of multiple files and directories
  and will show changes that touch any of them. Furthermore,
  directory filtering now shows the changes to any children of that
  directory, not just the directory object itself.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #97715)

* ``bzr shelve`` can now apply changes without storing anything on the
  shelf, via the new --destroy option.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr send`` now accepts --body to specify an initial message body.
  (Aaron bentley)

* ``bzr xxx --usage`` where xxx is a command now shows a usage
  message and the options without the descriptive help sections
  (like Description and Examples). A message is also given
  explaining how to see the complete help, i.e. ``bzr help xxx``.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Content filters can now be used to provide custom conversion
  between the canonical format of content (i.e. as stored) and
  the convenience format of content (i.e. as created in working
  trees). See ``bzr help content-filters`` for further details.
  (Ian Clatworthy, Alexander Belchenko)

* End-of-line conversion is now supported for formats supporting
  content filtering. See ``bzr help eol`` for details.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Newly-blessed `join` command allows combining two trees into one.
  (Aaron Bentley)

Improvements
************

* A new format name alias ``default-rich-root`` has been added and
  points at the closest relative of the default format that supports 
  rich roots. (Jelmer Vernooij, #338061)

* Branching from a stacked branch using ``bzr*://`` will now stream
  the data when the target repository does not need topological
  ordering, reducing round trips and network overhead. This uses the
  existing smart server methods added in 1.13, so will work on any
  1.13 or newer server. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``bzr cat`` and ``bzr export`` now supports a ``--filters`` option
  that displays/saves the content after content filters are applied.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzr ignore`` gives a more informative message when existing
  version controlled files match the ignore pattern. (Neil
  Martinsen-Burrell, #248895)

* ``bzr log`` now has ``--include-merges`` as an alias for ``--levels 0``.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzr send`` is faster on repositories with deep histories.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* IPv6 literals are accepted in URLs.
  (stlman, Martin Pool, Jelmer Vernooij, #165014)

* Progress bars now show the rate of network activity for
  ``bzr+ssh://`` and ``bzr://`` connections.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Prompt for user names if they are not in the configuration. 
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #256612)

* Pushing to a stacked pack-format branch on a 1.12 or older smart server
  now takes many less round trips.  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins,
  #294479)
  
* Streaming push can be done to older repository formats.  This is
  implemented using a new ``Repository.insert_stream_locked`` RPC.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* The "ignoring files outside view: .." message has been re-worded
  to "Ignoring files outside view. View is .." to reduce confusion
  about what was being considered and what was being ignored.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* The ``long`` log formatter now shows [merge] indicators. If
  only one level of revisions is displayed and merges are found,
  the ``long`` and ``short`` log formatters now tell the user
  how to see the hidden merged revisions.  (Ian Clatworthy)

* The ``brisbane-core`` project has delivered its beta format
  ``development6-rich-root``. This format is suitable for judicious
  testing by early adopters. In particular if you are benchmarking bzr
  performance please be sure to test using this format. At this stage
  more information is best obtained by contacting the Bazaar mailing list
  or IRC channel if you are interested in using this format. We will make
  end user documentation available closer to blessing the format as
  production ready. (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel, Ian Clatworthy,
  Vincent Ladeuil, Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool)

* Tildes are no longer escaped. No more %7Euser/project/branch!
  (Jonathan Lange)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Pushing a new stacked branch will also push the parent inventories for
  revisions at the stacking boundary.  This makes sure that the stacked
  branch has enough data to calculate inventory deltas for all of its
  revisions (without requiring the fallback branch).  This avoids
  "'AbsentContentFactory' object has no attribute 'get_bytes_as'" errors
  when fetching the stacked branch from a 1.13 (or later) smart server.
  This partially fixes #354036.  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* End-Of-Line content filters are now loaded correctly.
  (Ian Clatworthy, Brian de Alwis, #355280)

* Authentication plugins now receive all the parameters from the request
  itself (aka host, port, realm, path, etc). Previously, only the 
  authentication section name, username and encoded password were 
  provided. (Jean-Francois Roy)

* bzr gives a better message if an invalid regexp is passed to ``bzr log
  -m``.  (Anne Mohsen, Martin Pool)

* ``bzr split`` now says "See also: join" (Aaron Bentley, #335015)

* ``bzr version-info`` now works in empty branches. (Jelmer Vernooij,
  #313028)

* Fix "is not a stackable format" error when pushing a
  stackable-format branch with an unstackable-format repository to a
  destination with a default stacking policy.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Fixed incorrect "Source format does not support stacking" warning
  when pushing to a smart server.  (Andrew Bennetts, #334114)

* Fix 'make check-dist-tarball' failure by converting paths to unicode when
  needed. (Vincent Ladeuil, #355454)

* Fixed "Specified file 'x/y/z' is outside current view: " occurring
  on ``bzr add x/y/z`` in formats supporting views when no view is
  defined.  (Ian Clatworthy, #344708)

* It is no longer possible to fetch between repositories while the
  target repository is in a write group. This prevents race conditions
  that prevent the use of RPC's to perform fetch, and thus allows
  optimising more operations. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``merge --force`` works again. (Robert Collins, #342105)

* No more warnings are issued about ``sha`` being deprecated under python-2.6.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #346593)

* Pushing a new branch to a server that has a stacking policy will now
  upgrade from the local branch format when the stacking policy points at
  a branch which is itself stackable, because we know the client can read
  both branches, we know that the trunk for the project can be read too,
  so the upgrade will not inconvenience users. (Robert Collins, #345169)

* Pushing a new stacked branch will also push the parent inventories for
  revisions at the stacking boundary.  This makes sure that the stacked
  branch has enough data to calculate inventory deltas for all of its
  revisions (without requiring the fallback branch).  This avoids
  "'AbsentContentFactory' object has no attribute 'get_bytes_as'" errors
  when fetching the stacked branch from a 1.13 (or later) smart server.
  This partially fixes #354036.  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* The full test suite is passing again on OSX. Several minor issues (mostly
  test related) have been fixed. (Vincent Ladeuil, #355273).

* The GNU Changelog formatter is slightly improved in the case where
  the delta is empty, and now correctly claims not to support tags.
  (Andrea Bolognani)

* Shelve can now shelve changes to a symlink target.
  (James Westby, #341558)

* The help for the ``info`` command has been corrected.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #351931)

* Upgrade will now use a sensible default format if the source repository
  uses rich roots.  (Jelmer Vernooij, #252908)

Documentation
*************

* Expanded the index of the developer documentation. (Eric Siegerman)

* New topic `bzr help debug-flags`.  (Martin Pool)

* The generated manpage now explicitly lists aliases as commands.
  (James Westby, #336998)

API Changes
***********

* APIs deprecated in 1.6 and previous versions of bzr are now removed.
  (Martin Pool)

* ``CommitReporter`` is no longer called with ``unchanged`` status during
  commit - this was a full-tree overhead that bzr no longer performs.
  (Robert Collins)

* New abstract ``UIFactory`` method ``get_username`` which will be called to 
  obtain the username to use when connecting to remote machines. 
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New API ``Inventory.filter()`` added that filters an inventory by
  a set of file-ids so that only those fileids, their parents and
  their children are included.  (Ian Clatworthy)

* New sort order for ``get_record_stream`` ``groupcompress`` which
  sorts optimally for use with groupcompress compressors. (John Arbash
  Meinel, Robert Collins)

* Repository APIs ``get_deltas_for_revisions()`` and
  ``get_revision_delta()`` now support an optional ``specific_fileids``
  parameter. If provided, the deltas are filtered so that only those
  file-ids, their parents and their children are included.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* The ``get_credentials`` and ``set_credentials`` methods of 
  ``AuthenticationConfig`` now accept an optional realm argument.
  (Jean-Francois Roy)

* The ``pb`` argument to ``fetch()`` is deprecated.
  (Martin Pool)

* The ``Serializer`` class and the serializer ``format registry`` have moved
  from ``bzrlib.xml_serializer`` to ``bzrlib.serializer``. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* The smart server jail now hooks into BzrDir.open to prevent any BzrDir
  that is not inside the backing transport from being opened.  See the
  module documentation for ``bzrlib.smart.request`` for details.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* ``Tree.get_symlink_target`` now always returns a unicode string result
  or None. Previously it would return the bytes from reading the link
  which could be in any arbitrary encoding. (Robert Collins)

Testing
*******

* ``bzrlib.tests.TestCase`` now fails the test if its own ``setUp``
  and ``tearDown`` weren't called.  This catches faulty tests that
  forget to upcall when overriding ``setUp`` and ``tearDown``.  Those
  faulty tests were not properly isolated.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* Fix test_msgeditor.MsgEditorTest test isolation.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #347130)

* ``medusa`` is not used anymore as an FTP test server starting with
  python2.6. A new FTP test server based on ``pyftplib`` can be used
  instead. This new server is a soft dependency as medusa which is still
  preferred if both are available (modulo python version).
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

Internals
*********

* Added ``chk_map`` for fast, trie-based storage of tuple to string maps.
  (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil)

* Added ``bzrlib.chk_map`` for fast, trie-based storage of tuple to string
  maps.  (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil)

* Added ``bzrlib.inventory_delta`` module.  This will be used for
  serializing and deserializing inventory deltas for more efficient
  streaming on the the network.  (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``Branch._get_config`` has been added, which splits out access to the
  specific config file from the branch. This is used to let RemoteBranch
  avoid constructing real branch objects to access configuration settings.
  (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``Branch`` now implements ``set_stacked_on_url`` in the base class as
  the implementation is generic and should impact foreign formats. This
  helps performance for ``RemoteBranch`` push operations to new stacked
  branches. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``BtreeIndex._spill_mem_keys_to_disk()`` now generates disk index with
  optmizations turned off. This only has effect when processing > 100,000
  keys during something like ``bzr pack``. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr selftest`` now accepts ``--subunit`` to run in subunit output
  mode. Requires ``lp:subunit`` installed to work, but is not a hard
  dependency. (Robert Collins)

* ``BzrDir.open_branch`` now takes an optional ``ignore_fallbacks``
  parameter for controlling opening of stacked branches.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)
  
* ``CommitBuilder`` has a new method, ``record_iter_changes`` which works
  in terms of an iter_changes iterator rather than full tree scanning.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``DirState`` can now be passed a custom ``SHA1Provider`` object
  enabling it to store the SHA1 and stat of the canonical (post
  content filtered) form. (Ian Clatworthy)

* New ``assertLength`` method based on one Martin has squirreled away
  somewhere. (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

* New hook ``BzrDir.pre_open`` which runs before opening ``BzrDir``
  objects, allowing better enforcement of the smart server jail when
  dealing with stacked branches. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* New hook ``RioVersionInfoBuilder.revision``, allowing extra entries 
  to be added to the stanza that is printed for a particular revision.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New repository method ``refresh_data`` to cause any repository to
  make visible data inserted into the repository by a smart server
  fetch operation. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``register_filter_stack_map`` now takes an optional fallback parameter,
  a callable to invoke if a preference has a value not in the map
  of filter stacks. This enhancement allows, for example,  bzr-svn to
  handle existing svn properties that define a list of keywords to be
  expanded.  (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``RemoteBranchConfig`` will use a new verb ``Branch.set_config_option``
  to write config settings to smart servers that support this, saving
  5 round trips on the stacked streaming acceptance test.
  (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``RemoteBranch`` now provides ``_get_config`` for access to just the
  branch specific configuration from a remote server, which uses the 
  already existing ``Branch.get_config_file`` smart verb.
  (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``RemoteRepository`` will now negatively cache missing revisions during
  ``get_parent_map`` while read-locked. Write-locks are unaffected.
  (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* Removed ``InterRemoteToOther``, ``InterOtherToRemote`` and
  ``InterPackToRemotePack`` classes, as they are now unnecessary.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``RepositoryFormat`` as a new attribute ``fast_deltas`` to indicate
  whether the repository can efficiently generate deltas between trees
  regardless of tree size. (Robert Collins)

* ``Repository.iter_files_bytes()`` now properly returns an "iterable of
  byte strings" (aka 'chunked') for the content. It previously was
  returning a plain string, which worked, but performed very poorly when
  building a working tree (file.writelines(str) is very inefficient). This
  can have a large effect on ``bzr checkout`` times. (John Arbash Meinel)

* selftest now supports a --parallel option, with values of 'fork' or
  'subprocess' to run the test suite in parallel. Currently only linux
  machine work, other platforms need patches submitted. (Robert Collins,
  Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``tests.run_suite`` has a new parameter ``suite_decorators``, a list of 
  callables to use to decorate the test suite. Such decorators can add or
  remove tests, or even remote the test suite to another machine if
  desired. (Robert Collins)

* The smart server verb ``Repository.get_parent_map`` can now include
  information about ghosts when the special revision ``include-missing:``
  is in the requested parents map list. With this flag, ghosts are
  included as ``missing:REVISION_ID``. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``_walk_to_common_revisions`` will now batch up at least 50
  revisions before calling ``get_parent_map`` on the target,
  regardless of ``InterRepository``.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

bzr 1.13
########

:Codename: paraskavedekatriaphobia
:1.13: 2009-03-14
:1.13rc1: 2009-03-10
:1.13.1: 2009-03-23
:1.13.2: 2009-04-27

GNU Changelog output can now be produced by ``bzr log --gnu-changelog``.  Debug
flags can now be set in ``~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf``.  Lightweight checkouts and
stacked branches should both be much faster over remote connections.  

Changes From 1.13.1 to 1.13.2
*****************************

A regression was found in the 1.13.1 release. When bzr 1.13.1 and earlier push
a stacked branch they do not take care to push all the parent inventories for
the transferred revisions. This means that a smart server serving that branch
often cannot calculate inventory deltas for the branch (because smart server
does not/cannot open fallback repositories). Prior to 1.13 the server did not
have a verb to stream revisions out of a repository, so that's why this bug has
appeared now.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix for bug 354036 ErrorFromSmartServer - AbsentContentFactory object has no
  attribute 'get_bytes_as' exception while pulling from Launchpad 
  (Jean-Francois Roy, Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

Changes From 1.13final to 1.13.1
********************************

A couple regessions where found in the 1.13 release. The pyrex-generated C
extensions are missing from the .tar.gz and .zip files.  Documentation on how
to generate GNU ChangeLogs is wrong.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Change ``./bzr``'s ``_script_version`` to match ./bzrlib/__init__.py
  version_info. (Bob Tanner, Martin Pool, #345232)

* Distribution archives for 1.13 do not contain generated C extension modules
  (Jean-Francois Roy, Bob Tanner, #344465)

* GNU ChangeLog output can now be produced by bzr log --format gnu-changelog is
  incorrect (Deejay, Bob Tanner, Martin Pool, Robert Collins, #343928)

* ``merge --force`` works again. (Robert Collins, #342105)

Changes From 1.13rc1 to 1.13final
*********************************

* Fix "is not a stackable format" error when pushing a
  stackable-format branch with an unstackable-format repository to a
  destination with a default stacking policy.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Progress bars now show the rate of network activity for
  ``bzr+ssh://`` and ``bzr://`` connections.  (Andrew Bennetts)

Compatibility Breaks
********************

* ``bzr log --line`` now indicates which revisions are merges with
  `[merge]` after the date.  Scripts which parse the output of this
  command may need to be adjusted.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

New Features
************

* ``bzr reconfigure`` now supports --with-trees and --with-no-trees
  options to change the default tree-creation policy of shared
  repositories.  (Matthew Fuller, Marius Kruger, #145033)

* Debug flags can now be set in ``~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf``.
  (Martin Pool)

* Filtered views provide a mask over the tree so that users can focus
  on a subset of a tree when doing their work. See ``Filtered views``
  in chapter 7 of the User Guide and ``bzr help view`` for details.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* GNU Changelog output can now be produced by ``bzr log --gnu-changelog``.
  (Andrea Bolognani, Martin Pool)

* The ``-Dmemory`` flag now gives memory information on Windows.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Multiple authors for a commit can now be recorded by using the "--author"
  option multiple times. (James Westby, #185772)

* New clean-tree command, from bzrtools.  (Aaron Bentley, Jelmer Vernoij)

* New command ``bzr launchpad-open`` opens a Launchpad web page for that
  branch in your web browser, as long as the branch is on Launchpad at all.
  (Jonathan Lange)

* New API for getting bugs fixed by a revision: Revision.iter_bugs().
  (Jonathan Lange)

Improvements
************

* All bzr ``Hooks`` classes are now registered in
  ``bzrlib.hooks.known_hooks``. This removes the separate list from
  ``bzrlib.tests`` and ensures that all hooks registered there are
  correctly isolated by the test suite (previously
  ``MutableTreeHooks`` were not being isolated correctly). Further, 
  documentation for hooks is now dynamically generated from the
  present HookPoints. ``bzr hooks`` will now also report on all the
  hooks present in the ``bzrlib.hooks.known_hooks`` registry.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``bzr add`` no longer prints ``add completed`` on success. Failure
  still prints an error message. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzr branch`` now has a ``--no-tree`` option which turns off the
  generation of a working tree in the new branch.
  (Daniel Watkins, John Klinger, #273993)

* Bazaar will now point out ``bzr+ssh://`` to the user when they 
  use ssh://. (Jelmer Vernooij, #330535)

* ``bzr -v info`` now omits the number of committers branch statistic,
  making it many times faster for large projects. To include that
  statistic in the output, use ``bzr -vv info``.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzr push`` to a ``bzr`` url (``bzr://``, ``bzr+ssh://`` etc) will
  stream if the server is version 1.13 or greater, reducing roundtrips
  significantly. (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* Lightweight Checkouts and Stacked Branches should both be much
  faster over remote connections. Building the working tree now
  batches up requests into approx 5MB requests, rather than a separate
  request for each file. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Support for GSSAPI authentication when using HTTP or HTTPS. 
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* The ``bzr shelve`` prompt now includes a '?' help option to explain the
  short options better. (Daniel Watkins, #327429)

* ``bzr lp-open`` now falls back to the push location if it cannot find a
  public location. (Jonathan Lange, #332372)

* ``bzr lp-open`` will try to find the Launchpad URL for the location
  passed on the command line. This makes ``bzr lp-open lp:foo`` work as
  expected. (Jonathan Lange, #332705)

* ``bzr send`` now supports MH-E via ``emacsclient``. (Eric Gillespie)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Allows ``bzr log <FILE>`` to be called in an empty branch without
  backtracing. (Vincent Ladeuil, #346431)

* Bazaar now gives a better message including the filename if it's
  unable to read a file in the working directory, for example because
  of a permission error.  (Martin Pool, #338653)

* ``bzr cat -r<old> <path>`` doesn't traceback anymore when <path> has a
  file id in the working tree different from the one in revision <old>.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #341517, #253806)

* ``bzr send`` help is more specific about how to apply merge
  directives.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #253470)

* ``bzr missing`` now uses ``Repository.get_revision_delta()`` rather
  than fetching trees and determining a delta itself. (Jelmer
  Vernooij, #315048)

* ``bzr push`` to a smart server no longer causes "Revision
  {set([('null:',)])} not present ..." errors when the branch has
  multiple root revisions. (Andrew Bennetts, #317654)

* ``bzr shelve`` now properly handle patches with no terminating newline.
  (Benoît PIERRE, #303569)

* ``bzr unshelve`` gives a more palatable error if passed a non-integer
  shelf id. (Daniel Watkins)

* Export now handles files that are not present in the tree.
  (James Westby, #174539)

* Fixed incorrect "Source format does not support stacking" warning
  when pushing to a smart server.  (Andrew Bennetts, #334114)
  
* Fixed "sprout() got an unexpected keyword argument 'source_branch'"
  error branching from old repositories.
  (Martin Pool, #321695)

* Make ``bzr push --quiet <non-local location>`` less chatty.
  (Kent Gibson, #221461)

* Many Branch hooks would not fire with ``bzr://`` and ``bzr+ssh://``
  branches, and this was not noticed due to a bug in the test logic
  for branches. This is now fixed and a test added to prevent it
  reoccuring. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* Restore the progress bar on Windows. We were disabling it when TERM
  wasn't set, but Windows doesn't set TERM. (Alexander Belchenko,
  #334808)

* ``setup.py build_ext`` now gives a proper error when an extension
  fails to build. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Symlinks to non ascii file names are now supported.
  (Robert Collins, Vincent Ladeuil, #339055, #272444)    

* Under rare circumstances (aka nobody reported a bug about it), the ftp
  transport could revert to ascii mode. It now stays in binary mode except
  when needed.  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Unshelve does not generate warnings about progress bars.
  (Aaron Bentley, #328148)

* shelve cleans up properly when unversioned files are specified.
  (Benoît Pierre, Aaron Bentley)

Documentation
*************

* Added ``Organizing your workspace`` to the User Guide appendices,
  summarizing some common ways of organizing trees, branches and
  repositories and the processes/workflows implied/enabled by each.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Hooks can now be self documenting. ``bzrlib.hooks.Hooks.create_hook``
  is the entry point for this feature. (Robert Collins)

* The documentation for ``shelve`` and ``unshelve`` has been clarified.
  (Daniel Watkins, #327421, #327425)

API Changes
***********

* ``bzr selftest`` now fails if the bazaar sources contain trailing
  whitespace, non-unix style line endings and files not ending in a
  newline. About 372 files and 3243 lines with trailing whitespace was
  updated to comply with this. The code already complied with the other
  criteria, but now it is enforced. (Marius Kruger)

* ``bzrlib.branch.PushResult`` was renamed to 
  ``bzrlib.branch.BranchPushResult``. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``Branch.fetch`` and ``Repository.fetch`` now return None rather
  than a count of copied revisions and failed revisions. A while back
  we stopped ever reporting failed revisions because we started
  erroring instead, and the copied revisions count is not used in the
  UI at all - indeed it only reflects the repository status not
  changes to the branch itself. (Robert Collins)

* ``Inventory.apply_delta`` now raises an AssertionError if a file-id
  appears multiple times within the delta. (Ian Clatworthy)

* MutableTree.commit now favours the "authors" argument, with the old
  "author" argument being deprecated.

* Remove deprecated EmptyTree.  (Martin Pool)

* ``Repository.fetch`` now accepts an optional ``fetch_spec``
  parameter.  A ``SearchResult`` or ``MiniSearchResult`` may be passed
  to ``fetch_spec`` instead of a ``last_revision`` to specify exactly
  which revisions to fetch. (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``RepositoryAcquisitionPolicy.acquire_repository`` now returns a
  tuple of ``(repository, is_new_flag)``, rather than just the
  repository.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Revision.get_apparent_author() is now deprecated, replaced by
  Revision.get_apparent_authors(), which returns a list. The former
  now returns the first item that would be returned from the second.

* The ``BranchBuilder`` test helper now accepts a ``timestamp``
  parameter to ``build_commit`` and ``build_snapshot``.  (Martin Pool)

* The ``_fetch_*`` attributes on ``Repository`` are now on
  ``RepositoryFormat``, more accurately reflecting their intent (they
  describe a disk format capability, not state of a particular
  repository of that format). (Robert Collins)

Internals
*********

* Branching from a non-stacked branch on a smart protocol is now
  free of virtual file system methods.
  (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* Branch and Repository creation on a bzr+ssh://server are now done
  via RPC calls rather than VFS calls, reducing round trips for
  pushing new branches substantially. (Robert Collins)

* ``Branch.clone`` now takes the ``repository_policy`` formerly used
  inside ``BzrDir.clone_on_transport``, allowing stacking to be
  configured before the branch tags and revision tip are set. This
  fixes a race condition cloning stacked branches that would cause
  plugins to have hooks called on non-stacked instances.
  (Robert Collins, #334187)

* ``BzrDir.cloning_metadir`` now has a RPC call. (Robert Collins)

* ``BzrDirFormat.__str__`` now uses the human readable description
  rather than the sometimes-absent disk label. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.fetch`` is now composed of a sender and a sink component
  allowing for decoupling over a network connection. Fetching from
  or into a RemoteRepository with a 1.13 server will use this to
  stream the operation.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.tests.run_suite`` accepts a runner_class parameter
  supporting the use of different runners. (Robert Collins)

* Change how file_ids and revision_ids are interned as part of
  inventory deserialization. Now we use the real ``intern()``, rather
  than our own workaround that would also cache a Unicode copy of the
  string, and never emptied the cache. This should slightly reduce
  memory consumption. (John Arbash Meinel)

* New branch method ``create_clone_on_transport`` that returns a
  branch object. (Robert Collins)

* New hook Commands['extend_command'] to allow plugins to access a
  command object before the command is run (or help generated from
  it), without overriding the command. (Robert Collins)

* New version of the ``BzrDir.find_repository`` verb supporting
  ``_network_name`` to support removing more _ensure_real calls.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``RemoteBranchFormat`` no longer claims to have a disk format string.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``Repository`` objects now have ``suspend_write_group`` and
  ``resume_write_group`` methods.  These are currently only useful
  with pack repositories. (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* ``BzrDirFormat``, ``BranchFormat`` and ``RepositoryFormat`` objects
  now have a ``network_name`` for passing the format across RPC calls.
  (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``RepositoryFormat`` objects now all have a new attribute
  ``_serializer`` used by fetch when reserialising is required.
  (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* Some methods have been pulled up from ``BzrBranch`` to ``Branch``
  to aid branch types that are not bzr branch objects (like
  RemoteBranch). (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* Test adaptation has been made consistent throughout the built in
  tests. ``TestScenarioApplier``, ``multiply_tests_from_modules``,
  ``adapt_tests``, ``adapt_modules`` have all been deleted. Please
  use ``multiply_tests``, or for lower level needs ``apply_scenarios``
  and ``apply_scenario``. (Robert Collins)

* ``TestSkipped`` is now detected by TestCase and passed to the
  ``TestResult`` by calling ``addSkip``. For older TestResult objects,
  where ``addSkip`` is not available, ``addError`` is still called.
  This permits test filtering in subunit to strip out skipped tests
  resulting in a faster fix-shrink-list-run cycle. This is compatible
  with the testtools protocol for skips. (Robert Collins)

* The ``_index`` of ``KnitVersionedFiles`` now supports the ability
  to scan an underlying index that is going to be incorporated into
  the ``KnitVersionedFiles`` object, to determine if it has missing
  delta references. The method is ``scan_unvalidated_index``.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* There is a RemoteSink object which handles pushing to smart servers.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* ``TransportTraceDecorator`` now logs ``put_bytes_non_atomic`` and
  ``rmdir`` calls. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFiles`` record adapters have had their signature change
  from ``(record, record.get_bytes_as(record.storage_kind))`` to
  ``(record)`` reducing excess duplication and allowing adapters
  to access private data in record to obtain content more
  efficiently. (Robert Collins)

* We no longer probe to see if we should create a working tree during
  clone if we cannot get a local_abspath for the new bzrdir.
  (Robert Collins)


bzr 1.12
########

:Codename: 1234567890
:1.12: 2009-02-13
:1.12rc1: 2009-02-10

This release of Bazaar contains many improvements to the speed,
documentation and functionality of ``bzr log`` and the display of logged
revisions by ``bzr status``.  bzr now also gives a better indication of
progress, both in the way operations are drawn onto a text terminal, and
by showing the rate of network IO.

Changes from RC1 to Final
*************************

* ``bzr init --development-wt5[-rich-root]`` would fail because of
  circular import errors. (John Arbash Meinel, #328135)

* Expanded the help for log and added a new help topic called
  ``log-formats``.  (Ian Clatworthy)

Compatibility Breaks
********************

* By default, ``bzr status`` after a merge now shows just the pending
  merge tip revisions. This improves the signal-to-noise ratio after
  merging from trunk and completes much faster. To see all merged
  revisions, use the new ``-v`` flag.  (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzr log --line`` now shows any tags after the date and before
  the commit message. If you have scripts which parse the output
  from this command, you may need to adjust them accordingly.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzr log --short`` now shows any additional revision properties
  after the date and before the commit message.  Scripts that parse 
  output of the log command in this situation may need to adjust.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

* The experimental formats ``1.12-preview`` and ``1.12-preview-rich-root``
  have been renamed ``development-wt5`` and ``development-wt5-rich-root``
  respectively, given they are not ready for release in 1.12.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``read_bundle_from_url`` has been deprecated. (Vincent Ladeuil)

New Features
************

* Add support for filtering ``bzr missing`` on revisions.  Remote revisions
  can be filtered using ``bzr missing -r -20..-10`` and local revisions can
  be filtered using ``bzr missing --my-revision -20..-10``.
  (Marius Kruger)

* ``bzr log -p`` displays the patch diff for each revision.
  When logging a file, the diff only includes changes to that file.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #202331, #227335)

* ``bzr log`` supports a new option called ``-n N`` or ``--level N``.
  A value of 0 (zero) means "show all nested merge revisions" while
  a value of 1 (one) means "show just the top level". Values above
  1 can be used to see a limited amount of nesting. That can be
  useful for seeing the level or two below PQM submits for example.
  To force the ``--short`` and ``--line`` formats to display all nested
  merge revisions just like ``--long`` does by default, use a command
  like ``bzr log --short -n0``. To display just the mainline using
  ``--long`` format, ``bzr log --long -n1``.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr add`` more clearly communicates success vs failure.
  (Daniel Watkins)

* ``bzr init`` will now print a little less verbose output.
  (Marius Kruger)

* ``bzr log`` is now much faster in many use cases, particularly
  at incrementally displaying results and filtering by a
  revision range. (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzr log --short`` and ``bzr log --line`` now show tags, if any,
  for each revision. The tags are shown comma-separated inside
  ``{}``. For short format, the tags appear at the end of line
  before the optional ``[merge]`` indicator. For line format,
  the tags appear after the date. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Progress bars now show the rate of activity for some sftp 
  operations, and they are drawn different.  (Martin Pool, #172741)

* Progress bars now show the rate of activity for urllib and pycurl based
  http client implementations. The operations are tracked at the socket
  level for better precision.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Rule-based preferences can now accept multiple patterns for a set of
  rules.  (Marius Kruger)

* The ``ancestor:`` revision spec will now default to referring to the
  parent of the branch if no other location is given.
  (Daniel Watkins, #198417)

* The debugger started as a result of setting ``$BZR_PDB`` works
  around a bug in ``pdb``, http://bugs.python.org/issue4150.  The bug
  can cause truncated tracebacks in Python versions before 2.6.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* VirtualVersionedFiles now implements
  ``iter_lines_added_or_present_in_keys``. This allows the creation of 
  new branches based on stacked bzr-svn branches. (#311997)

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr annotate --show-ids`` doesn't give a backtrace on empty files
  anymore.
  (Anne Mohsen, Vincent Ladeuil, #314525)

* ``bzr log FILE`` now correctly shows mainline revisions merging
  a change to FILE when the ``--short`` and ``--line`` log formats
  are used. (Ian Clatworthy, #317417)

* ``bzr log -rX..Y FILE`` now shows the history of FILE provided
  it existed in Y or X, even if the file has since been deleted or
  renamed. If no range is given, the current/basis tree and
  initial tree are searched in that order. More generally, log
  now interprets filenames in their historical context.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #175520)

* ``bzr status`` now reports nonexistent files and continues, then
  errors (with code 3) at the end.  (Karl Fogel, #306394)

* Don't require the present compression base in knits to be the same
  when adding records in knits. (Jelmer Vernooij, #307394)

* Fix a problem with CIFS client/server lag on Windows colliding with
  an invariant-per-process algorithm for generating AtomicFile names
  (Adrian Wilkins, #304023)

* Many socket operations now handle EINTR by retrying the operation.
  Previously EINTR was treated as an unrecoverable failure.  There is
  a new ``until_no_eintr`` helper function in ``bzrlib.osutils``.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Support symlinks with non-ascii characters in the symlink filename.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #319323)

* There was a bug in how we handled resolving when a file is deleted
  in one branch, and modified in the other. If there was a criss-cross
  merge, we would cause the deletion to conflict a second time.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, John Arbash Meinel)

* There was another bug in how we chose the correct intermediate LCA in
  criss-cross merges leading to several kind of changes be incorrectly
  handled.
  (John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil)

* Unshelve now handles deleted paths without crashing. (Robert Collins)

Documentation
*************

* Improved plugin developer documentation.  (Martin Pool)

API Changes
***********

* ``ProgressBarStack`` is deprecated; instead use
  ``ui_factory.nested_progress_bar`` to create new progress bars.
  (Martin Pool)

* ForeignVcsMapping() now requires a ForeignVcs object as first
  argument. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ForeignVcsMapping.show_foreign_revid() has been moved to
  ForeignVcs. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``read_bundle_from_url`` is deprecated in favor of
  ``read_mergeable_from_url``.  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Revision specifiers are now registered in
  ``bzrlib.revisionspec.revspec_registry``, and the old list of 
  revisionspec classes (``bzrlib.revisionspec.SPEC_TYPES``) has been
  deprecated. (Jelmer Vernooij, #321183)

* The progress and UI classes have changed; the main APIs remain the
  same but code that provides a new UI or progress bar class may
  need to be updated.  (Martin Pool)

Internals
*********

* Default User Interface (UI) is CLIUIFactory when bzr runs in a dumb
  terminal. It is sometimes desirable do override this default by forcing
  bzr to use TextUIFactory. This can be achieved by setting the
  BZR_USE_TEXT_UI environment variable (emacs shells, as opposed to
  compile buffers, are such an example).
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* New API ``Branch.iter_merge_sorted_revisions()`` that iterates over
  ``(revision_id, depth, revno, end_of_merge)`` tuples.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* New ``Branch.dotted_revno_to_revision_id()`` and
  ``Branch.revision_id_to_dotted_revno()`` APIs that pick the most
  efficient way of doing the mapping.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Refactor cmd_serve so that it's a little easier to build commands that
  extend it, and perhaps even a bit easier to read.  (Jonathan Lange)

* ``TreeDelta.show()`` now accepts a ``filter`` parameter allowing log
  formatters to retrict the output.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)


bzr 1.11
########

:Codename: "Eyes up!"
:Released: 2009-01-19

This first monthly release of Bazaar for 2009 improves Bazaar's operation
in Windows, Mac OS X, and other situations where file names are matched
without regard to capitalization: Bazaar tries to match the case of an
existing file.  This release of Bazaar also improves the efficiency of
Tortoise Windows Shell integration and lets it work on 64-bit platforms.

The UI through which Bazaar supports historic formats has been improved,
so 'bzr help formats' now gives a simpler and shorter list, with clear
advice.

This release also fixes a number of bugs, particularly a glitch that can
occur when there are concurrent writes to a pack repository.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix failing test when CompiledChunksToLines is not available.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Stacked branches don't repeatedly open their transport connection.
  (John Arbash Meinel)



bzr 1.11rc1
###########

:Codename: "Eyes up!"
:Released: 2009-01-09

Changes
*******

* Formats using Knit-based repository formats are now explicitly
  marked as deprecated. (Ian Clatworthy)

New Features
************

* Add support for `bzr tags -r 1..2`, that is we now support showing
  tags applicable for a specified revision range. (Marius Kruger)

* ``authentication.conf`` now accepts pluggable read-only credential
  stores. Such a plugin (``netrc_credential_store``) is now included,
  handles the ``$HOME/.netrc`` file and can server as an example to
  implement other plugins.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``shelve --list`` can now be used to list shelved changes.
  (Aaron Bentley)

Improvements
************

* Add trailing slash to directories in all output of ``bzr ls``, except
  ``bzr ls --null``. (Gordon P. Hemsley, #306424)

* ``bzr revision-info`` now supports a -d option to specify an
  alternative branch. (Michael Hudson)

* Add connection to a C++ implementation of the Windows Shell Extension
  which is able to fully replace the current Python implemented one.
  Advantages include 64bit support and reduction in overhead for
  processes which drag in shell extensions.
  (Mark Hammond)

* Support the Claws mail client directly, rather than via
  xdg-email. This prevents the display of an unnecessary modal
  dialog in Claws, informing the user that a file has been
  attached to the message, and works around bug #291847 in
  xdg-utils which corrupts the destination address.

* When working on a case-insensitive case-preserving file-system, as
  commonly found with Windows, bzr will often ignore the case of the
  arguments specified by the user in preference to the case of an existing
  item on the file-system or in the inventory to help prevent
  counter-intuitive behaviour on Windows. (Mark Hammond)

Bug Fixes
*********
  
* Allow BzrDir implementation to implement backing up of 
  control directory. (#139691)

* ``bzr push`` creating a new stacked branch will now only open a
  single connection to the target machine. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Don't call iteritems on transport_list_registry, because it may
  change during iteration.  (Martin Pool, #277048)

* Don't make a broken branch when pushing an unstackable-format branch
  that's in a stackable shared repository to a location with default
  stack-on location.  (Andrew Bennetts, #291046)

* Don't require embedding user in HTTP(S) URLs do use authentication.conf.
  (Ben Jansen, Vincent Ladeuil, #300347)

* Fix a problem with CIFS client/server lag on windows colliding with
  an invariant-per-process algorithm for generating AtomicFile names
  (Adrian Wilkins, #304023)

* Fix bogus setUp signature in UnavailableFTPServer.
  (Gary van der Merwe, #313498)

* Fix compilation error in ``_dirstate_helpers_c`` on SunOS/Solaris.
  (Jari Aalto)

* Fix SystemError in ``_patiencediff_c`` module by calling
  PyErr_NoMemory() before returning NULL in PatienceSequenceMatcher_new.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #303206)

* Give proper error message for diff with non-existent dotted revno.
  (Marius Kruger, #301969)

* Handle EACCES (permission denied) errors when launching a message
  editor, and emit warnings when a configured editor cannot be
  started. (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``$HOME/.netrc`` file is now recognized as a read-only credential store
  if configured in ``authentication.conf`` with 'password_encoding=netrc'
  in the appropriate sections.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #103029)

* Opening a stacked branch now properly shares the connection, rather
  than opening a new connection for the stacked-on branch.
  (John Arbash meinel)

* Preserve transport decorators while following redirections.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #245964, #270863)

* Provides a finer and more robust filter for accepted redirections.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #303959, #265070)

* ``shelve`` paths are now interpreted relative to the current working
  tree.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``Transport.readv()`` defaults to not reading more than 100MB in a
  single array. Further ``RemoteTransport.readv`` sets this to 5MB to
  work better with how it splits its requests.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #303538)

* Pack repositories are now able to reload the pack listing and retry
  the current operation if another action causes the data to be
  repacked.  (John Arbash Meinel, #153786)

* ``pull -v`` now respects the log_format configuration variable.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``push -v`` now works on non-initial pushes.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Use the short status format when the short format is used for log.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #87179)

* Allow files to be renamed or moved via remove + add-by-id. (Charles
  Duffy, #314251)

Documentation
*************

* Improved the formats help topic to explain why multiple formats
  exist and to provide guidelines in selecting one. Introduced
  two new supporting help topics: current-formats and other-formats.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

API Changes
***********

* ``LRUCache(after_cleanup_size)`` was renamed to
  ``after_cleanup_count`` and the old name deprecated. The new name is
  used for clarity, and to avoid confusion with
  ``LRUSizeCache(after_cleanup_size)``. (John Arbash Meinel)

* New ``ForeignRepository`` base class, to help with foreign branch 
  support (e.g. svn).  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``node_distances`` and ``select_farthest`` can no longer be imported
  from ``bzrlib.graph``.  They can still be imported from
  ``bzrlib.deprecated_graph``, which has been the preferred way to
  import them since before 1.0.  (Andrew Bennetts)
  
* The logic in commit now delegates inventory basis calculations to
  the ``CommitBuilder`` object; this requires that the commit builder
  in use has been updated to support the new ``recording_deletes`` and
  ``record_delete`` methods. (Robert Collins)

Testing
*******

* An HTTPS server is now available (it requires python-2.6). Future bzr
  versions will allow the use of the python-2.6 ssl module that can be
  installed for 2.5 and 2.4.

* ``bzr selftest`` now fails if new trailing white space is added to
  the bazaar sources. It only checks changes not committed yet. This
  means that PQM will now reject changes that introduce new trailing
  whitespace. (Marius Kruger)

* Introduced new experimental formats called ``1.12-preview`` and
  ``1.12-preview-rich-root`` to enable testing of related pending
  features, namely content filtering and filtered views.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

Internals
*********

* Added an ``InventoryEntry`` cache when deserializing inventories.
  Can cut the time to iterate over multiple RevisionsTrees in half.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Added ``bzrlib.fifo_cache.FIFOCache`` which is designed to have
  minimal overhead versus using a plain dict for cache hits, at the
  cost of not preserving the 'active' set as well as an ``LRUCache``.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzrlib.patience_diff.unified_diff`` now properly uses a tab
  character to separate the filename from the date stamp, and doesn't
  add trailing whitespace when a date stamp is not supplied.
  (Adeodato Simó, John Arbash Meinel)

* ``DirStateWorkingTree`` and ``DirStateWorkingTreeFormat`` added
  as base classes of ``WorkingTree4`` and ``WorkingTreeFormat4``
  respectively. (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``KnitVersionedFiles._check_should_delta()`` now uses the
  ``get_build_details`` api to avoid multiple hits to the index, and
  to properly follow the ``compression_parent`` rather than assuming
  it is the left-hand parent. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``KnitVersionedFiles.get_record_stream()`` will now chose a
  more optimal ordering when the keys are requested 'unordered'.
  Previously the order was fully random, now the records should be
  returned from each pack in turn, in forward I/O order.
  (John Arbash Meinel)
    
* ``mutter()`` will now flush the ``~/.bzr.log`` if it has been more
  than 2s since the last time it flushed. (John Arbash Meinel)

* New method ``bzrlib.repository.Repository.add_inventory_by_delta``
  allows adding an inventory via an inventory delta, which can be
  more efficient for some repository types. (Robert Collins)

* Repository ``CommitBuilder`` objects can now accumulate an inventory
  delta. To enable this functionality call ``builder.recording_deletes``
  and additionally call ``builder.record_delete`` when a delete
  against the basis occurs. (Robert Collins)

* The default http handler has been changed from pycurl to urllib.
  The default is still pycurl for https connections. (The only
  advantage of pycurl is that it checks ssl certificates.)
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``VersionedFiles.get_record_stream()`` can now return objects with a
  storage_kind of ``chunked``. This is a collection (list/tuple) of
  strings. You can use ``osutils.chunks_to_lines()`` to turn them into
  guaranteed 'lines' or you can use ``''.join(chunks)`` to turn it
  into a fulltext. This allows for some very good memory savings when
  asking for many texts that share ancestry, as the individual chunks
  can be shared between versions of the file. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``pull -v`` and ``push -v`` use new function
  ``bzrlib.log.show_branch_change`` (Aaron Bentley)



bzr 1.10
########

:Released: 2008-12-05

Bazaar 1.10 has several performance improvements for copying revisions
(especially for small updates to large projects).  There has also been a
significant amount of effort in polishing stacked branches.  The commands
``shelve`` and ``unshelve`` have become core commands, with an improved
implementation.

The only changes versus bzr-1.10rc1 are bugfixes for stacked branches.

bug Fixes
*********

* Don't set a pack write cache size from RepoFetcher, because the
  cache is not coherent with reads and causes ShortReadvErrors.
  This reverses the change that fixed #294479.
  (Martin Pool, #303856)

* Properly handle when a revision can be inserted as a delta versus
  when it needs to be expanded to a fulltext for stacked branches.
  There was a bug involving merge revisions. As a method to help
  prevent future difficulties, also make stacked fetches sort
  topologically. (John Arbash Meinel, #304841)


bzr 1.10rc1
###########

:Released: 2008-11-28

This release of Bazaar focuses on performance improvements when pushing
and pulling revisions, both locally and to remote networks.  The popular
``shelve`` and ``unshelve`` commands, used to interactively revert and
restore work in progress, have been merged from bzrtools into the bzr
core.  There are also bug fixes for portability, and for stacked branches.

New Features
************

* New ``commit_message_template`` hook that is called by the commit
  code to generate a template commit message. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New `shelve` and `unshelve` commands allow undoing and redoing changes.
  (Aaron Bentley)

Improvements
************

* ``(Remote)Branch.copy_content_into`` no longer generates the full revision
  history just to set the last revision info.
  (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel)

* Fetches between formats with different serializers (such as
  pack-0.92-subtree and 1.9-rich-root) are faster now.  This is due to
  operating on batches of 100 revisions at time rather than
  one-by-one.  (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel)

* Search index files corresponding to pack files we've already used
  before searching others, because they are more likely to have the
  keys we're looking for.  This reduces the number of iix and tix
  files accessed when pushing 1 new revision, for instance.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Signatures to transfer are calculated more efficiently in
  ``item_keys_introduced_by``.  (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel)

* The generic fetch code can once again copy revisions and signatures
  without extracting them completely to fulltexts and then serializing
  them back down into byte strings. This is a significant performance
  improvement when fetching from a stacked branch.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #300289)

* When making a large readv() request over ``bzr+ssh``, break up the
  request into more manageable chunks. Because the RPC is not yet able
  to stream, this helps keep us from buffering too much information at
  once. (John Arbash Meinel)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Better message when the user needs to set their Launchpad ID.
  (Martin Pool, #289148)

* ``bzr commit --local`` doesn't access the master branch anymore.
  This fixes a regression introduced in 1.9.  (Marius Kruger, #299313)

* Don't call the system ``chdir()`` with an empty path. Sun OS seems
  to give an error in that case.  Also, don't count on ``getcwd()``
  being able to allocate a new buffer, which is a gnu extension.
  (John Arbash Meinel, Martin Pool, Harry Hirsch, #297831)

* Don't crash when requesting log --forward <file> for a revision range
  starting with a dotted revno.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #300055)

* Don't create text deltas spanning stacked repositories; this could
  cause "Revision X not present in Y" when later accessing them.
  (Martin Pool, #288751)

* Pack repositories are now able to reload the pack listing and retry
  the current operation if another action causes the data to be
  repacked.  (John Arbash Meinel, #153786)

* PermissionDenied errors from smart servers no longer cause
  "PermissionDenied: "None"" on the client.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #299254)

* Pushing to a stacked pack repository now batches writes, the same
  way writes are batched to ordinary pack repository.  This makes
  pushing to a stacked branch over the network much faster.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #294479)

* TooManyConcurrentRequests no longer occur when a fetch fails and
  tries to abort a write group.  This allows the root cause (e.g. a
  network interruption) to be reported.  (Andrew Bennetts, #297014)

* RemoteRepository.get_parent_map now uses fallback repositories.
  (Aaron Bentley, #297991?, #293679?)

API Changes
***********

* ``CommitBuilder`` now validates the strings it will be committing,
  to ensure that they do not have characters that will not be properly
  round-tripped. For now, it just checks for characters that are
  invalid in the XML form. (John Arbash Meinel, #295161)

* Constructor parameters for NewPack (internal to pack repositories)
  have changed incompatibly.

* ``Repository.abort_write_group`` now accepts an optional
  ``suppress_errors`` flag.  Repository implementations that override
  ``abort_write_group`` will need to be updated to accept the new
  argument.  Subclasses that only override ``_abort_write_group``
  don't need to change.

* Transport implementations must provide copy_tree_to_transport.  A default
  implementation is provided for Transport subclasses.

Testing
*******

* ``bzr selftest`` now fails if no doctests are found in a module
  that's expected to have them.  (Martin Pool)

* Doctests now only report the first failure.  (Martin Pool)


bzr 1.9
#######

:Released: 2008-11-07

This release of Bazaar adds a new repository format, ``1.9``, with smaller
and more efficient index files.  This format can be specified when
creating a new repository, or used to losslessly upgrade an existing
repository.  bzr 1.9 also speeds most operations over the smart server
protocol, makes annotate faster, and uses less memory when making
checkouts or pulling large amounts of data.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix "invalid property value 'branch-nick' for None" regression with
  branches bound to svn branches.  (Martin Pool, #293440)

* Fix SSL/https on Python2.6.  (Vincent Ladeuil, #293054)

* ``SFTPTransport.readv()`` had a bug when requests were out-of-order.
  This only triggers some-of-the-time on Knit format repositories.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #293746)


bzr 1.9rc1
##########

:Released: 2008-10-31

New Features
************

* New Branch hook ``transform_fallback_location`` allows a function to
  be called when looking up the stacked source. (Michael Hudson)

* New repository formats ``1.9`` and ``1.9-rich-root``. These have all
  the functionality of ``1.6``, but use the new btree indexes.
  These indexes are both smaller and faster for access to historical
  information.  (John Arbash Meinel)

Improvements
************

* ``BTreeIndex`` code now is able to prefetch extra pages to help tune
  the tradeoff between bandwidth and latency. Should be tuned
  appropriately to not impact commands which need minimal information,
  but provide a significant boost to ones that need more context. Only
  has a direct impact on the ``--development2`` format which uses
  btree's for the indexes. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr dump-btree`` is a hidden command introduced to allow dumping
  the contents of a compressed btree file.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr pack`` now tells the index builders to optimize for size. For
  btree index repositories, this can save 25% of the index size
  (mostly in the text indexes). (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr push`` to an existing branch or repository on a smart server
  is faster, due to Bazaar making more use of the ``get_parent_map``
  RPC when querying the remote branch's revision graph.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* default username for bzr+ssh and sftp can be configured in
  authentication.conf. (Aaron Bentley)

* launchpad-login now provides a default username for bzr+ssh and sftp
  URLs, allowing username-free URLs to work for everyone. (Aaron Bentley)

* ``lp:`` lookups no longer include usernames, making them shareable and
  shorter. (Aaron Bentley)

* New ``PackRepository.autopack`` smart server RPC, which does
  autopacking entirely on the server.  This is much faster than
  autopacking via plain file methods, which downloads a large amount
  of pack data and then re-uploads the same pack data into a single
  file.  This fixes a major (although infrequent) cause of lengthy
  delays when using a smart server.  For example, pushing the 10th
  revision to a repository with 9 packs now takes 44 RPCs rather than
  179, and much less bandwidth too.  This requires Bazaar 1.9 on both
  the client and the server, otherwise the client will fallback to the
  slower method.  (Andrew Bennetts)

Bug Fixes
*********

* A failure to load a plugin due to an IncompatibleAPI exception is
  now correctly reported. (Robert Collins, #279451)

* API versioning support now has a multiple-version checking api
  ``require_any_api``. (Robert Collins, #279447)

* ``bzr branch --stacked`` from a smart server to a standalone branch
  works again.  This fixes a regression in 1.7 and 1.8.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #270397)

* ``bzr co`` uses less memory. It used to unpack the entire WT into
  memory before writing it to disk. This was a little bit faster, but
  consumed lots of memory. (John Arbash Meinel, #269456)

* ``bzr missing --quiet`` no longer prints messages about whether
  there are missing revisions.  The exit code indicates whether there
  were or not.  (Martin Pool, #284748)

* Fixes to the ``annotate`` code. The fast-path which re-used the
  stored deltas was accidentally disabled all the time, instead of
  only when a branch was stacked. Second, the code would accidentally
  re-use a delta even if it wasn't against the left-parent, this
  could only happen if ``bzr reconcile`` decided that the parent
  ordering was incorrect in the file graph.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* "Permission denied" errors that occur when pushing a new branch to a
  smart server no longer cause tracebacks.  (Andrew Bennetts, #278673)

* Some compatibility fixes for building the extensions with MSVC and
  for python2.4. (John Arbash Meinel, #277484)

* The index logic is now able to reload the list of pack files if and
  index ends up disappearing. We still don't reload if the pack data
  itself goes missing after checking the index. This bug appears as a
  transient failure (file not found) when another process is writing
  to the repository.  (John Arbash Meinel, #153786)

* ``bzr switch`` and ``bzr bind`` will now update the branch nickname if
  it was previously set. All checkouts will now refer to the bound branch
  for a nickname if one was not explicitly set.
  (Marius Kruger, #230903)

Documentation
*************

* Improved hook documentation. (Michael Ernst)

API Changes
***********

* commands.plugins_cmds is now a CommandRegistry, not a dict.

Internals
*********

* New AuthenticationConfig.set_credentials method allows easy programmatic
  configuration of authetication credentials.


bzr 1.8
#######

:Released: 2008-10-16

Bazaar 1.8 includes several fixes that improve working tree performance,
display of revision logs, and merges.  The bzr testsuite now passes on OS
X and Python 2.6, and almost completely passes on Windows.  The
smartserver code has gained several bug fixes and performance
improvements, and can now run server-side hooks within an http server.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix "Must end write group" error when another error occurs during
  ``bzr push``.  (Andrew Bennetts, #230902)

Portability
***********

* Some Pyrex versions require the WIN32 macro defined to compile on
  that platform.  (Alexander Belchenko, Martin Pool, #277481)


bzr 1.8rc1
##########

:Released: 2008-10-07

Changes
*******

* ``bzr log file`` has been changed. It now uses a different method
  for determining which revisions to show as merging the changes to
  the file. It now only shows revisions which merged the change
  towards your mainline. This simplifies the output, makes it faster,
  and reduces memory consumption.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr merge`` now defaults to having ``--reprocess`` set, whenever
  ``--show-base`` is not supplied.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr+http//`` will now optionally load plugins and write logs on the
  server. (Marius Kruger)

* ``bzrlib._dirstate_helpers_c.pyx`` does not compile correctly with
  Pyrex 0.9.4.1 (it generates C code which causes segfaults). We
  explicitly blacklist that version of the compiler for that
  extension. Packaged versions will include .c files created with
  pyrex >= 0.9.6 so it doesn't effect releases, only users running
  from the source tree. (John Arbash Meinel, #276868)

Features
********

* bzr is now compatible with python-2.6. python-2.6 is not yet officially
  supported (nor released, tests were conducted with the dev version of
  python-2.6rc2), but all known problems have been fixed.  Feedback
  welcome.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #269535)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr annotate`` will now include uncommitted changes from the local
  working tree by default. Such uncommitted changes are given the
  revision number they would get if a commit was done, followed with a
  ? to indicate that its not actually known. (Robert Collins, #3439)

* ``bzr branch`` now accepts a ``--standalone`` option, which creates a
  standalone branch regardless of the presence of shared repositories.
  (Daniel Watkins)

* ``bzr push`` is faster in the case there are no new revisions to
  push.  It is also faster if there are no tags in the local branch.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* File changes during a commit will update the tree stat cache.
  (Robert Collins)

* Location aliases can now accept a trailing path.  (Micheal Hudson)

* New hooks ``Lock.hooks`` when LockDirs are acquired and released.
  (Robert Collins, MartinPool)

* Switching in heavyweight checkouts uses the master branch's context, not
  the checkout's context.  (Adrian Wilkins)

* ``status`` on large trees is now faster, due to optimisations in the
  walkdirs code. Of particular note, the walkdirs code now performs
  a temporary ``chdir()`` while reading a single directory; if your
  platform has non thread-local current working directories (and is
  not windows which has its own implementation), this may introduce a
  race condition during concurrent uses of bzrlib. The bzrlib CLI
  will not encounter this as it is single threaded for working tree
  operations. (Robert Collins)

* The C extensions now build on python 2.4 (Robert Collins, #271939)

* The ``-Dhpss`` debug flag now reports the number of smart server
  calls per medium to stderr.  This is in addition to the existing
  detailed logging to the .bzr.log trace file.  (Andrew Bennetts)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Avoid random failures arising from misinterpreted ``errno`` values
  in ``_readdir_pyx.read_dir``.
  (Martin Pool, #279381)

* Branching from a shared repository on a smart server into a new
  repository now preserves the repository format.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #269214)

* ``bzr log`` now accepts a ``--change`` option.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #248427)

* ``bzr missing`` now accepts an ``--include-merges`` option.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #233817)

* Don't try to filter (internally) '.bzr' from the files to be deleted if
  it's not there.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #272648)

* Fix '_in_buffer' AttributeError when using the -Dhpss debug flag.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Fix TooManyConcurrentRequests errors caused by a connection failure
  when doing ``bzr pull`` or ``bzr merge`` from a ``bzr+ssh`` URL.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #246233)

* Fixed ``bzr st -r branch:PATH_TO_BRANCH`` where the other branch
  is in a different repository than the current one.
  (Lukáš Lalinský, #144421)

* Make the first line of the manpage preamble a comment again.
  (David Futcher, #242106)

* Remove use of optional parameter in GSSAPI FTP support, since
  it breaks newer versions of Python-Kerberos. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* The autopacking logic will now always create a single new pack from
  all of the content which it deems is worth moving. This avoids the
  'repack a single pack' bug and should result in better packing
  overall.  (John Arbash Meinel, #242510, #172644)

* Trivial documentation fix.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #270471)

* ``bzr switch`` and ``bzr bind`` will now update the branch nickname if
  it was previously set. All checkouts will now refer to the bound branch
  for a nickname if one was not explicitly set.
  (Marius Kruger, #230903)

Documentation
*************

* Explain revision/range identifiers. (Daniel Clemente)

API Changes
***********

* ``CommitBuilder.record_entry_contents`` returns one more element in
  its result tuple - an optional file system hash for the hash cache
  to use. (Robert Collins)

* ``dirstate.DirState.update_entry`` will now only calculate the sha1
  of a file if it is likely to be needed in determining the output
  of iter_changes. (Robert Collins)

* The PackRepository, RepositoryPackCollection, NewPack classes have a
  slightly changed interface to support different index types; as a
  result other users of these classes need to supply the index types
  they want. (Robert Collins)

Testing
*******

* ``bzrlib.tests.repository_implementations`` has been renamed to
  ``bzrlib.tests.per_repository`` so that we have a common structure
  (and it is shorter). (John Arbash Meinel, #239343)

* ``LocalTransport.abspath()`` now returns a drive letter if the
  transport has one, fixing numerous tests on Windows.
  (Mark Hammond)

* PreviewTree is now tested via intertree_implementations.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* The full test suite is passing again on OSX.
  (Guillermo Gonzalez, Vincent Ladeuil)

* The full test suite passes when run with ``-Eallow_debug``.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

Internals
*********

* A new hook, ``Branch.open``, has been added, which is called when
  branch objects are opened. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.osutils._walkdirs_utf8`` has been refactored into common
  tree walking, and modular directory listing code to aid future
  performance optimisations and refactoring. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.trace.debug_memory`` can be used to get a quick memory dump
  in the middle of processing. It only reports memory if
  ``/proc/PID/status`` is available. (John Arbash Meinel)

* New method ``RevisionSpec.as_tree`` for representing the revision
  specifier as a revision tree object. (Lukáš Lalinský)

* New race-free method on MutableTree ``get_file_with_stat`` for use
  when generating stat cache results. (Robert Collins)

* New win32utils.get_local_appdata_location() provides access to a local
  directory for storing data.  (Mark Hammond)

* To be compatible with python-2.6 a few new rules should be
  observed. 'message' attribute can't be used anymore in exception
  classes, 'sha' and 'md5' modules have been deprecated (use
  osutils.[md5|sha]), object__init__ and object.__new__ don't accept
  parameters anymore.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)


bzr 1.7.1
#########

:Released:  2008-10-01

No changes from 1.7.1rc1.


bzr 1.7.1rc1
############

:Released: 2008-09-24

This release just includes an update to how the merge algorithm handles
file paths when we encounter complex history.

Features
********

* If we encounter a criss-cross in history, use information from
  direct Least Common Ancestors to resolve inventory shape (locations
  of files, adds, deletes, etc). This is similar in concept to using
  ``--lca`` for merging file texts, only applied to paths.
  (John Arbash Meinel)


bzr 1.7
#######

:Released: 2008-09-23

This release includes many bug fixes and a few performance and feature
improvements.  ``bzr rm`` will now scan for missing files and remove them,
like how ``bzr add`` scans for unknown files and adds them. A bit more
polish has been applied to the stacking code. The b-tree indexing code has
been brought in, with an eye on using it in a future repository format.
There are only minor installer changes since bzr-1.7rc2.

Features
********

* Some small updates to the win32 installer. Include localization
  files found in plugins, and include the builtin distutils as part of
  packaging qbzr. (Mark Hammond)


bzr 1.7rc2
##########

:Released: 2008-09-17

A few bug fixes from 1.7rc1. The biggest change is a new
``RemoteBranch.get_stacked_on_url`` rpc. This allows clients that are
trying to access a Stacked branch over the smart protocol, to properly
connect to the stacked-on location.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Branching from a shared repository on a smart server into a new
  repository now preserves the repository format.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #269214)

* Branching from a stacked branch via ``bzr+ssh`` can properly connect
  to the stacked-on branch.  (Martin Pool, #261315)

* ``bzr init`` no longer re-opens the BzrDir multiple times.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Fix '_in_buffer' AttributeError when using the -Dhpss debug flag.
  (Andrew Bennetts)


bzr 1.7rc1
##########

:Released: 2008-09-09

This release candidate for bzr 1.7 has several bug fixes and a few
performance and feature improvements.  ``bzr rm`` will now scan for
missing files and remove them, like how ``bzr add`` scans for unknown
files and adds them. A bit more polish has been applied to the stacking
code. The b-tree indexing code has been brought in, with an eye on using
it in a future repository format.


Changes
*******

* ``bzr export`` can now export a subdirectory of a project.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``bzr remove-tree`` will now refuse to remove a tree with uncommitted
  changes, unless the ``--force`` option is specified.
  (Lukáš Lalinský, #74101)

* ``bzr rm`` will now scan for files that are missing and remove just
  them automatically, much as ``bzr add`` scans for new files that
  are not ignored and adds them automatically. (Robert Collins)

Features
********

* Support for GSSAPI authentication when using FTP as documented in
  RFC2228. (Jelmer Vernooij, #49623)

* Add support for IPv6 in the smart server. (Jelmer Vernooij, #165014)

Improvements
************

* A url like ``log+file:///tmp`` will log all access to that Transport
  to ``.bzr.log``, which may help in debugging or profiling.
  (Martin Pool)

* ``bzr branch`` and ``bzr push`` use the default stacking policy if the
  branch format supports it. (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr init`` and ``bzr init-repo`` will now print out the same as
  ``bzr info`` if it completed successfully.
  (Marius Kruger)

* ``bzr uncommit`` logs the old tip revision id, and displays how to
  restore the branch to that tip using ``bzr pull``.  This allows you
  to recover if you realize you uncommitted the wrong thing.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Fix problems in accessing stacked repositories over ``bzr://``.
  (Martin Pool, #261315)

* ``SFTPTransport.readv()`` was accidentally using ``list += string``,
  which 'works', but adds each character separately to the list,
  rather than using ``list.append(string)``. Fixing this makes the
  SFTP transport a little bit faster (~20%) and use a bit less memory.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* When reading index files, if we happen to read the whole file in a
  single request treat it as a ``_buffer_all`` request. This happens
  most often on small indexes over remote transports, where we default
  to reading 64kB. It saves a round trip for each small index during
  fetch operations. Also, if we have read more than 50% of an index
  file, trigger a ``_buffer_all`` on the next request. This works
  around some inefficiencies because reads don't fall neatly on page
  boundaries, so we would ignore those bytes, but request them again
  later. This could trigger a total read size of more than the whole
  file. (John Arbash Meinel)

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr rm`` is now aliased to ``bzr del`` for the convenience of svn
  users. (Robert Collins, #205416)

* Catch the infamous "select/poll returned error" which occurs when
  pycurl try to send a body request to an HTTP/1.0 server which has
  already refused to handle the request. (Vincent Ladeuil, #225020)

* Fix ``ObjectNotLocked`` errors when using various commands
  (including ``bzr cat`` and ``bzr annotate``) in combination with a
  smart server URL.  (Andrew Bennetts, #237067)

* ``FTPTransport.stat()`` would return ``0000`` as the permission bits
  for the containing ``.bzr/`` directory (it does not implement
  permissions). This would cause us to set all subdirectories to
  ``0700`` and files to ``0600`` rather than leaving them unmodified.
  Now we ignore ``0000`` as the permissions and assume they are
  invalid. (John Arbash Meinel, #259855)

* Merging from a previously joined branch will no longer cause
  a traceback. (Jelmer Vernooij, #203376)

* Pack operations on windows network shares will work even with large
  files. (Robert Collins, #255656)

* Running ``bzr st PATH_TO_TREE`` will no longer suppress merge
  status. Status is also about 7% faster on mozilla sized trees
  when the path to the root of the tree has been given. Users of
  the internal ``show_tree_status`` function should be aware that
  the show_pending flag is now authoritative for showing pending
  merges, as it was originally. (Robert Collins, #225204)

* Set valid default _param_name for Option so that ListOption can embed
  '-' in names. (Vincent Ladeuil, #263249)

* Show proper error rather than traceback when an unknown revision
  id is specified to ``bzr cat-revision``. (Jelmer Vernooij, #175569)

* Trailing text in the dirstate file could cause the C dirstate parser
  to try to allocate an invalid amount of memory. We now properly
  check and test for parsing a dirstate with invalid trailing data.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #186014)

* Unexpected error responses from a smart server no longer cause the
  client to traceback.  (Andrew Bennetts, #263527)

* Use a Windows api function to get a Unicode host name, rather than
  assuming the host name is ascii.
  (Mark Hammond, John Arbash Meinel, #256550)

* ``WorkingTree4`` trees will now correctly report missing-and-new
  paths in the output of ``iter_changes``. (Robert Collins)

Documentation
*************

* Updated developer documentation.  (Martin Pool)

API Changes
***********

* Exporters now take 4 parameters. (Robert Collins)

* ``Tree.iter_changes`` will now return False for the content change
  field when a file is missing in the basis tree and not present in
  the target tree. Previously it returned True unconditionally.
  (Robert Collins)

* The deprecated ``Branch.abspath`` and unimplemented
  ``Branch.rename_one`` and ``Branch.move`` were removed. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* BzrDir.clone_on_transport implementations must now accept a stacked_on
  parameter.  (Aaron Bentley)

* BzrDir.cloning_metadir implementations must now take a require_stacking
  parameter.  (Aaron Bentley)

Testing
*******

* ``addCleanup`` now takes ``*arguments`` and ``**keyword_arguments``
  which are then passed to the cleanup callable as it is run. In
  addition, addCleanup no longer requires that the callables passed to
  it be unique. (Jonathan Lange)

* Fix some tests that fail on Windows because files are deleted while
  still in use.
  (Mark Hammond)

* ``selftest``'s ``--starting-with`` option can now use predefined
  prefixes so that one can say ``bzr selftest -s bp.loom`` instead of
  ``bzr selftest -s bzrlib.plugins.loom``. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``selftest``'s ``--starting-with`` option now accepts multiple values.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

Internals
*********

* A new plugin interface, ``bzrlib.log.log_adapters``, has been added.
  This allows dynamic log output filtering by plugins.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.btree_index`` is now available, providing a b-tree index
  layer. The design is memory conservative (limited memory cache),
  faster to seek (approx 100 nodes per page, gives 100-way fan out),
  and stores compressed pages allowing more keys per page.
  (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzrlib.diff.DiffTree.show_diff`` now skips changes where the kind
  is unknown in both source and target.
  (Robert Collins, Aaron Bentley)

* ``GraphIndexBuilder.add_node`` and ``BTreeBuilder`` have been
  streamlined a bit. This should make creating large indexes faster.
  (In benchmarking, it now takes less time to create a BTree index than
  it takes to read the GraphIndex one.) (John Arbash Meinel)

* Mail clients for `bzr send` are now listed in a registry.  This
  allows plugins to add new clients by registering them with
  ``bzrlib.mail_client.mail_client_registry``.  All of the built-in
  clients now use this mechanism.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)


bzr 1.6.1
#########

:Released: 2008-09-05

A couple regressions were found in the 1.6 release. There was a
performance issue when using ``bzr+ssh`` to branch large repositories,
and some problems with stacking and ``rich-root`` capable repositories.


bzr 1.6.1rc2
############

:Released: 2008-09-03

Bug Fixes
*********

* Copying between ``rich-root`` and ``rich-root-pack`` (and vice
  versa) was accidentally using the inter-model fetcher, instead of
  recognizing that both were 'rich root' formats.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #264321)


bzr 1.6.1rc1
############

:Released: 2008-08-29

This release fixes a few regressions found in the 1.6 client. Fetching
changes was using an O(N^2) buffering algorithm, so for large projects it
would cause memory thrashing. There is also a specific problem with the
``--1.6-rich-root`` format, which prevented stacking on top of
``--rich-root-pack`` repositories, and could allow users to accidentally
fetch experimental data (``-subtree``) without representing it properly.
The ``--1.6-rich-root`` format has been deprecated and users are
recommended to upgrade to ``--1.6.1-rich-root`` immediately.  Also we
re-introduced a workaround for users who have repositories with incorrect
nodes (not possible if you only used official releases).
I should also clarify that none of this is data loss level issues, but
still sufficient enough to warrant an updated release.

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``RemoteTransport.readv()`` was being inefficient about how it
  buffered the readv data and processed it. It would keep appending to
  the same string (causing many copies) and then pop bytes out of the
  start of the string (causing more copies).
  With this patch "bzr+ssh://local" can improve dramatically,
  especially for projects with large files.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Revision texts were always meant to be stored as fulltexts. There
  was a bug in a bzr.dev version that would accidentally create deltas
  when copying from a Pack repo to a Knit repo. This has been fixed,
  but to support those repositories, we know always request full texts
  for Revision texts. (John Arbash Meinel, #261339)

* The previous ``--1.6-rich-root`` format used an incorrect xml
  serializer, which would accidentally support fetching from a
  repository that supported subtrees, even though the local one would
  not. We deprecated that format, and introduced a new one that uses
  the correct serializer ``--1.6.1-rich-root``.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #262333)


bzr 1.6
#######

:Released: 2008-08-25

Finally, the long awaited bzr 1.6 has been released. This release includes
new features like Stacked Branches, improved weave merge, and an updated
server protocol (now on v3) which will allow for better cross version
compatibility. With this release we have deprecated Knit format
repositories, and recommend that users upgrade them, we will continue to
support reading and writing them for the forseeable future, but we will
not be tuning them for performance as pack repositories have proven to be
better at scaling. This will also be the first release to bundle
TortoiseBzr in the standalone Windows installer.


bzr 1.6rc5
##########

:Released: 2008-08-19

Bug Fixes
*********

* Disable automatic detection of stacking based on a containing
  directory of the target. It interacted badly with push, and needs a
  bit more work to get the edges polished before it should happen
  automatically. (John Arbash Meinel, #259275)
  (This change was reverted when merged to bzr.dev)


bzr 1.6rc4
##########

:Released: 2008-08-18

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix a regression in knit => pack fetching.  We had a logic
  inversion, causing the fetch to insert fulltexts in random order,
  rather than preserving deltas.  (John Arbash Meinel, #256757)


bzr 1.6rc3
##########

:Released: 2008-08-14

Changes
*******

* Disable reading ``.bzrrules`` as a per-branch rule preferences
  file. The feature was not quite ready for a full release.
  (Robert Collins)

Improvements
************

* Update the windows installer to bundle TortoiseBzr and ``qbzr``
  into the standalone installer. This will be the first official
  windows release that installs Tortoise by default.
  (Mark Hammond)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix a regression in ``bzr+http`` support. There was a missing
  function (``_read_line``) that needed to be carried over from
  ``bzr+ssh`` support. (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``GraphIndex`` objects will internally read an entire index if more
  than 1/20th of their keyspace is requested in a single operation.
  This largely mitigates a performance regression in ``bzr log FILE``
  and completely corrects the performance regression in ``bzr log``.
  The regression was caused by removing an accomodation which had been
  supporting the index format in use. A newer index format is in
  development which is substantially faster. (Robert Collins)


bzr 1.6rc2
##########

:Released: 2008-08-13

This release candidate has a few minor bug fixes, and some regression
fixes for Windows.

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr upgrade`` on remote branches accessed via bzr:// and
  bzr+ssh:// now works.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Change the ``get_format_description()`` strings for
  ``RepositoryFormatKnitPack5`` et al to be single line messages.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Fix for a regression on Win32 where we would try to call
  ``os.listdir()`` on a file and not catch the exception properly.
  (Windows raises a different exception.) This would manifest in
  places like ``bzr rm file`` or ``bzr switch``.
  (Mark Hammond, John Arbash Meinel)

* ``Inventory.copy()`` was failing to set the revision property for
  the root entry. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* sftp transport: added missing ``FileExists`` case to
  ``_translate_io_exception`` (Christophe Troestler, #123475)

* The help for ``bzr ignored`` now suggests ``bzr ls --ignored`` for
  scripting use. (Robert Collins, #3834)

* The default ``annotate`` logic will now always assign the
  last-modified value of a line to one of the revisions that modified
  it, rather than a merge revision. This would happen when both sides
  claimed to have modified the line resulting in the same text. The
  choice is arbitrary but stable, so merges in different directions
  will get the same results.  (John Arbash Meinel, #232188)


bzr 1.6rc1
##########

:Released: 2008-08-06

This release candidate for bzr 1.6 solidifies the new branch stacking
feature.  Bazaar now recommends that users upgrade all knit repositories,
because later formats are much faster.  However, we plan to continue read/write and
upgrade support for knit repostories for the forseeable future.  Several
other bugs and performance issues were fixed.

Changes
*******

* Knit format repositories are deprecated and bzr will now emit
  warnings whenever it encounters one.  Use ``bzr upgrade`` to upgrade
  knit repositories to pack format.  (Andrew Bennetts)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr check`` can now be told which elements at a location it should
  check.  (Daniel Watkins)

* Commit now supports ``--exclude`` (or ``-x``) to exclude some files
  from the commit. (Robert Collins, #3117)

* Fetching data between repositories that have the same model but no
  optimised fetcher will not reserialise all the revisions, increasing
  performance. (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)

* Give a more specific error when target branch is not reachable.
  (James Westby)

* Implemented a custom ``walkdirs_utf8`` implementation for win32.
  This uses a pyrex extension to get direct access to the
  ``FindFirstFileW`` style apis, rather than using ``listdir`` +
  ``lstat``. Shows a very strong improvement in commands like
  ``status`` and ``diff`` which have to iterate the working tree.
  Anywhere from 2x-6x faster depending on the size of the tree (bigger
  trees, bigger benefit.) (John Arbash Meinel)

* New registry for log properties handles  and the method in
  LongLogFormatter to display the custom properties returned by the
  registered handlers. (Guillermo Gonzalez, #162469)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Add more tests that stacking does not create deltas spanning
  physical repository boundaries.
  (Martin Pool, #252428)

* Better message about incompatible repositories.
  (Martin Pool, #206258)

* ``bzr branch --stacked`` ensures the destination branch format can
  support stacking, even if the origin does not.
  (Martin Pool)

* ``bzr export`` no longer exports ``.bzrrules``.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzr serve --directory=/`` now correctly allows the whole
  filesystem to be accessed on Windows, not just the root of the drive
  that Python is running from.
  (Adrian Wilkins, #240910)

* Deleting directories by hand before running ``bzr rm`` will not
  cause subsequent errors in ``bzr st`` and ``bzr commit``.
  (Robert Collins, #150438)

* Fix a test case that was failing if encoding wasn't UTF-8.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #247585)

* Fix "no buffer space available" error when branching with the new
  smart server protocol to or from Windows.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #246180)

* Fixed problem in branching from smart server.
  (#249256, Michael Hudson, Martin Pool)

* Handle a file turning in to a directory in TreeTransform.
  (James Westby, #248448)

API Changes
***********

* ``MutableTree.commit`` has an extra optional keywork parameter
  ``exclude`` that will be unconditionally supplied by the command
  line UI - plugins that add tree formats may need an update.
  (Robert Collins)

* The API minimum version for plugin compatibility has been raised to
  1.6 - there are significant changes throughout the code base.
  (Robert Collins)

* The generic fetch code now uses three attributes on Repository objects
  to control fetch. The streams requested are controlled via :
  ``_fetch_order`` and ``_fetch_uses_deltas``. Setting these
  appropriately allows different repository implementations to recieve
  data in their optimial form. If the ``_fetch_reconcile`` is set then
  a reconcile operation is triggered at the end of the fetch.
  (Robert Collins)

* The ``put_on_disk`` and ``get_tar_item`` methods in
  ``InventoryEntry`` were deprecated. (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``Repository.is_shared`` doesn't take a read lock. It didn't
  need one in the first place (nobody cached the value, and
  ``RemoteRepository`` wasn't taking one either). This saves a round
  trip when probing Pack repositories, as they read the ``pack-names``
  file when locked. And during probe, locking the repo isn't very
  useful. (John Arbash Meinel)

Internals
*********

* ``bzrlib.branchbuilder.BranchBuilder`` is now much more capable of
  putting together a real history without having to create a full
  WorkingTree. It is recommended that tests that are not directly
  testing the WorkingTree use BranchBuilder instead.  See
  ``BranchBuilder.build_snapshot`` or
  ``TestCaseWithMemoryTree.make_branch_builder``.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzrlib.builtins.internal_tree_files`` broken into two giving a new
  helper ``safe_relpath_files`` - used by the new ``exclude``
  parameter to commit. (Robert Collins)

* Make it easier to introduce new WorkingTree formats.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* The code for exporting trees was refactored not to use the
  deprecated ``InventoryEntry`` methods. (Ian Clatworthy)

* RuleSearchers return () instead of [] now when there are no matches.
  (Ian Clatworthy)


bzr 1.6beta3
############

:Released: 2008-07-17

This release adds a new 'stacked branches' feature allowing branches to
share storage without being in the same repository or on the same machine.
(See the user guide for more details.)  It also adds a new hook, improved
weaves, aliases for related locations, faster bzr+ssh push, and several
bug fixes.

Features
********

* New ``pre_change_branch_tip`` hook that is called before the
  branch tip is moved, while the branch is write-locked.  See the User
  Reference for signature details.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Rule-based preferences can now be defined for selected files in
  selected branches, allowing commands and plugins to provide
  custom behaviour for files matching defined patterns.
  See ``Rule-based preferences`` (part of ``Configuring Bazaar``)
  in the User Guide and ``bzr help rules`` for more information.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Sites may suggest a branch to stack new branches on.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Stacked branches are now supported. See ``bzr help branch`` and
  ``bzr help push``.  Branches must be in the ``development1`` format
  to stack, though the stacked-on branch can be of any format.
  (Robert Collins)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr export --format=tgz --root=NAME -`` to export a gzipped tarball
  to stdout; also ``tar`` and ``tbz2``.
  (Martin Pool)

* ``bzr (re)merge --weave`` will now use a standard Weave algorithm,
  rather than the annotation-based merge it was using. It does so by
  building up a Weave of the important texts, without needing to build
  the full ancestry. (John Arbash Meinel, #238895)

* ``bzr send`` documents and better supports ``emacsclient`` (proper
  escaping of mail headers and handling of the MUA Mew).
  (Christophe Troestler)

* Remembered locations can be specified by aliases, e.g. :parent, :public,
  :submit.  (Aaron Bentley)

* The smart protocol now has improved support for setting branches'
  revision info directly.  This makes operations like push
  faster.  The new request method name is
  ``Branch.set_last_revision_ex``.  (Andrew Bennetts)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Bazaar is now able to be a client to the web server of IIS 6 and 7.
  The broken implementations of RFC822 in Python and RFC2046 in IIS
  combined with boundary-line checking in Bazaar previously made this
  impossible. (NB, IIS 5 does not suffer from this problem).
  (Adrian Wilkins, #247585)

* ``bzr log --long`` with a ghost in your mainline now handles that
  ghost properly. (John Arbash Meinel, #243536)

* ``check`` handles the split-up .bzr layout correctly, so no longer
  requires a branch to be present.
  (Daniel Watkins, #64783)

* Clearer message about how to set the PYTHONPATH if bzrlib can't be
  loaded.
  (Martin Pool, #205230)

* Errors about missing libraries are now shown without a traceback,
  and with a suggestion to install the library.  The full traceback is
  still in ``.bzr.log`` and can be shown with ``-Derror``.
  (Martin Pool, #240161)

* Fetch from a stacked branch copies all required data.
  (Aaron Bentley, #248506)

* Handle urls such as ftp://user@host.com@www.host.com where the user
  name contains an @.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #228058)

* ``needs_read_lock`` and ``needs_write_lock`` now suppress an error during
  ``unlock`` if there was an error in the original function. This helps
  most when there is a failure with a smart server action, since often the
  connection closes and we cannot unlock.
  (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel, #125784)

* Obsolete hidden command ``bzr fetch`` removed.
  (Martin Pool, #172870)

* Raise the correct exception when doing ``-rbefore:0`` or ``-c0``.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #239933)

* You can now compare file revisions in Windows diff programs from
  Cygwin Bazaar.
  (Matt McClure, #209281)

* revision_history now tolerates mainline ghosts for Branch format 6.
  (Aaron Bentley, #235055)

* Set locale from environment for third party libs.
  (Martin von Gagern, #128496)

Documentation
*************

* Added *Using stacked branches* to the User Guide.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Updated developer documentation.
  (Martin Pool)

Testing
*******

* ``-Dmemory`` will cause /proc/PID/status to be catted before bzr
  exits, allowing low-key analysis of peak memory use. (Robert Collins)

* ``TestCaseWithTransport.make_branch_and_tree`` tries harder to return
  a tree with a ``branch`` attribute of the right format.  This was
  preventing some ``RemoteBranch`` tests from actually running with
  ``RemoteBranch`` instances.  (Andrew Bennetts)

API Changes
***********

* Removed ``Repository.text_store``, ``control_store``, etc.  Instead,
  there are new attributes ``texts, inventories, revisions,
  signatures``, each of which is a ``VersionedFiles``.  See the
  Repository docstring for more details.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``Branch.pull`` now accepts an ``_override_hook_target`` optional
  parameter.  If you have a subclass of ``Branch`` that overrides
  ``pull`` then you should add this parameter.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``bzrlib.check.check()`` has been deprecated in favour of the more
  aptly-named ``bzrlib.check.check_branch()``.
  (Daniel Watkins)

* ``Tree.print_file`` and ``Repository.print_file`` are deprecated.
  These methods are bad APIs because they write directly to sys.stdout.
  bzrlib does not use them internally, and there are no direct tests
  for them. (Alexander Belchenko)

Internals
*********

* ``cat`` command no longer uses ``Tree.print_file()`` internally.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

* New class method ``BzrDir.open_containing_tree_branch_or_repository``
  which eases the discovery of the tree, the branch and the repository
  containing a given location.
  (Daniel Watkins)

* New ``versionedfile.KeyMapper`` interface to abstract out the access to
  underlying .knit/.kndx etc files in repositories with partitioned
  storage. (Robert Collins)

* Obsolete developer-use command ``weave-join`` has been removed.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``RemoteToOtherFetcher`` and ``get_data_stream_for_search`` removed,
  to support new ``VersionedFiles`` layering.
  (Robert Collins)


bzr 1.6beta2
############

:Released: 2008-06-10

This release contains further progress towards our 1.6 goals of shallow
repositories, and contains a fix for some user-affecting bugs in the
repository layer.  Building working trees during checkout and branch is
now faster.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Avoid KnitCorrupt error extracting inventories from some repositories.
  (The data is not corrupt; an internal check is detecting a problem
  reading from the repository.)
  (Martin Pool, Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins, #234748)

* ``bzr status`` was breaking if you merged the same revision twice.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

* Fix infinite loop consuming 100% CPU when a connection is lost while
  reading a response body via the smart protocol v1 or v2.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Inserting a bundle which changes the contents of a file with no trailing
  end of line, causing a knit snapshot in a 'knits' repository will no longer
  cause KnitCorrupt. (Robert Collins)

* ``RemoteBranch.pull`` needs to return the ``self._real_branch``'s
  pull result. It was instead just returning None, which breaks ``bzr
  pull``. (John Arbash Meinel, #238149)

* Sanitize branch nick before using it as an attachment filename in
  ``bzr send``. (Lukáš Lalinský, #210218)

* Squash ``inv_entry.symlink_target`` to a plain string when
  generating DirState details. This prevents from getting a
  ``UnicodeError`` when you have symlinks and non-ascii filenames.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #135320)

Improvements
************

* Added the 'alias' command to set/unset and display aliases. (Tim Penhey)

* ``added``, ``modified``, and ``unknowns`` behaviour made consistent (all three
  now quote paths where required). Added ``--null`` option to ``added`` and
  ``modified`` (for null-separated unknowns, use ``ls --unknown --null``)
  (Adrian Wilkins)

* Faster branching (1.09x) and lightweight checkouts (1.06x) on large trees.
  (Ian Clatworthy, Aaron Bentley)

Documentation
*************

* Added *Bazaar Zen* section to the User Guide. (Ian Clatworthy)

Testing
*******

* Fix the test HTTPServer to be isolated from chdir calls made while it is
  running, allowing it to be used in blackbox tests. (Robert Collins)

API Changes
***********

* ``WorkingTree.set_parent_(ids/trees)`` will now filter out revisions
  which are in the ancestry of other revisions. So if you merge the same
  tree twice, or merge an ancestor of an existing merge, it will only
  record the newest. (If you merge a descendent, it will replace its
  ancestor). (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

* ``RepositoryPolicy.__init__`` now requires stack_on and stack_on_pwd,
  through the derived classes do not.  (Aaron Bentley)

Internals
*********

* ``bzrlib.bzrdir.BzrDir.sprout`` now accepts ``stacked`` to control
  creating stacked branches. (Robert Collins)

* Knit record serialisation is now stricter on what it will accept, to
  guard against potential internal bugs, or broken input. (Robert Collins)

bzr 1.6beta1
############

:Released: 2008-06-02

Commands that work on the revision history such as push, pull, missing,
uncommit and log are now substantially faster.  This release adds a
translation of some of the user documentation into Spanish.  (Contributions of
other translations would be very welcome.)  Bazaar 1.6beta1 adds a new network
protocol which is used by default and which allows for more efficient transfers
and future extensions.


Notes When Upgrading
********************

* There is a new version of the network protocol used for bzr://, bzr+ssh://
  and bzr+http:// connections.  This will allow more efficient requests and
  responses, and more graceful fallback when a server is too old to
  recognise a request from a more recent client.  Bazaar 1.6 will
  interoperate with 0.16 and later versions, but servers should be upgraded
  when possible.  Bazaar 1.6 no longer interoperates with 0.15 and earlier via
  these protocols.  Use alternatives like SFTP or upgrade those servers.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #83935)

Changes
*******

* Deprecation warnings will not be suppressed when running ``bzr selftest``
  so that developers can see if their code is using deprecated functions.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

Features
********

* Adding ``-Derror`` will now display a traceback when a plugin fails to
  load. (James Westby)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr branch/push/pull -r XXX`` now have a helper function for finding
  the revno of the new revision (``Graph.find_distance_to_null``). This
  should make something like ``bzr branch -r -100`` in a shared, no-trees
  repository much snappier. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr log --short -r X..Y`` no longer needs to access the full revision
  history. This makes it noticeably faster when logging the last few
  revisions. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr ls`` now accepts ``-V`` as an alias for ``--versioned``.
  (Jerad Cramp, #165086)

* ``bzr missing`` uses the new ``Graph.find_unique_ancestors`` and
  ``Graph.find_differences`` to determine missing revisions without having
  to search the whole ancestry. (John Arbash Meinel, #174625)

* ``bzr uncommit`` now uses partial history access, rather than always
  extracting the full revision history for a branch. This makes it
  resolve the appropriate revisions much faster (in testing it drops
  uncommit from 1.5s => 0.4s). It also means ``bzr log --short`` is one
  step closer to not using full revision history.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #172649)

Bugfixes
********

* ``bzr merge --lca`` should handle when two revisions have no common
  ancestor other than NULL_REVISION. (John Arbash Meinel, #235715)

* ``bzr status`` was breaking if you merged the same revision twice.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

* ``bzr push`` with both ``--overwrite`` and ``-r NNN`` options no longer
  fails.  (Andrew Bennetts, #234229)

* Correctly track the base URL of a smart medium when using bzr+http://
  URLs, which was causing spurious "No repository present" errors with
  branches in shared repositories accessed over bzr+http.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #230550)

* Define ``_remote_is_at_least_1_2`` on ``SmartClientMedium`` so that all
  implementations have the attribute.  Fixes 'PyCurlTransport' object has no
  attribute '_remote_is_at_least_1_2' attribute errors.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #220806)

* Failure to delete an obsolete pack file should just give a warning
  message, not a fatal error.  It may for example fail if the file is still
  in use by another process.
  (Martin Pool)

* Fix MemoryError during large fetches over HTTP by limiting the amount of
  data we try to read per ``recv`` call.  The problem was observed with
  Windows and a proxy, but might affect other environments as well.
  (Eric Holmberg, #215426)

* Handle old merge directives correctly in Merger.from_mergeable.  Stricter
  get_parent_map requirements exposed a latent bug here.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Issue a warning and ignore passwords declared in authentication.conf when
  used for an ssh scheme (sftp or bzr+ssh).
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #203186)

* Make both http implementations raise appropriate exceptions on 403
  Forbidden when POSTing smart requests.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #230223)

* Properly *title* header names in http requests instead of capitalizing
  them.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #229076)

* The "Unable to obtain lock" error message now also suggests using
  ``bzr break-lock`` to fix it.  (Martin Albisetti, #139202)

* Treat an encoding of '' as ascii; this can happen when bzr is run
  under vim on Mac OS X.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

* ``VersionedFile.make_mpdiffs()`` was raising an exception that wasn't in
  scope. (Daniel Fischer #235687)

Documentation
*************

* Added directory structure and started translation of docs in spanish.
  (Martin Albisetti, Lucio Albenga)

* Incorporate feedback from Jelmer Vernooij and Neil Martinsen-Burrell
  on the plugin and integration chapters of the User Guide.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* More Bazaar developer documentation about packaging and release process,
  and about use of Python reprs.
  (Martin Pool, Martin Albisetti)

* Updated Tortise strategy document. (Mark Hammond)

Testing
*******

* ``bzrlib.tests.adapt_tests`` was broken and unused - it has been fixed.
  (Robert Collins)

* Fix the test HTTPServer to be isolated from chdir calls made while it is
  running, allowing it to be used in blackbox tests. (Robert Collins)

* New helper function for splitting test suites
  ``split_suite_by_condition``. (Robert Collins)

Internals
*********

* ``Branch.missing_revisions`` has been deprecated. Similar functionality
  can be obtained using ``bzrlib.missing.find_unmerged``. The api was
  fairly broken, and the function was unused, so we are getting rid of it.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

API Changes
***********

* ``Branch.abspath`` is deprecated; use the Tree or Transport
  instead.  (Martin Pool)

* ``Branch.update_revisions`` now takes an optional ``Graph``
  object. This can be used by ``update_revisions`` when it is
  checking ancestry, and allows callers to prefer request to go to a
  local branch.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Branch, Repository, Tree and BzrDir should expose a Transport as an
  attribute if they have one, rather than having it indirectly accessible
  as ``.control_files._transport``.  This doesn't add a requirement
  to support a Transport in cases where it was not needed before;
  it just simplifies the way it is reached.  (Martin Pool)

* ``bzr missing --mine-only`` will return status code 0 if you have no
  new revisions, but the remote does. Similarly for ``--theirs-only``.
  The new code only checks one side, so it doesn't know if the other
  side has changes. This seems more accurate with the request anyway.
  It also changes the output to print '[This|Other] branch is up to
  date.' rather than displaying nothing.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``LockableFiles.put_utf8``, ``put_bytes`` and ``controlfilename``
  are now deprecated in favor of using Transport operations.
  (Martin Pool)

* Many methods on ``VersionedFile``, ``Repository`` and in
  ``bzrlib.revision``  deprecated before bzrlib 1.5 have been removed.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``RevisionSpec.wants_revision_history`` can be set to False for a given
  ``RevisionSpec``. This will disable the existing behavior of passing in
  the full revision history to ``self._match_on``. Useful for specs that
  don't actually need access to the full history. (John Arbash Meinel)

* The constructors of ``SmartClientMedium`` and its subclasses now require a
  ``base`` parameter.  ``SmartClientMedium`` implementations now also need
  to provide a ``remote_path_from_transport`` method.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* The default permissions for creating new files and directories
  should now be obtained from ``BzrDir._get_file_mode()`` and
  ``_get_dir_mode()``, rather than from LockableFiles.  The ``_set_file_mode``
  and ``_set_dir_mode`` variables on LockableFiles which were advertised
  as a way for plugins to control this are no longer consulted.
  (Martin Pool)

* ``VersionedFile.join`` is deprecated. This method required local
  instances of both versioned file objects and was thus hostile to being
  used for streaming from a smart server. The new get_record_stream and
  insert_record_stream are meant to efficiently replace this method.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``WorkingTree.set_parent_(ids/trees)`` will now filter out revisions
  which are in the ancestry of other revisions. So if you merge the same
  tree twice, or merge an ancestor of an existing merge, it will only
  record the newest. (If you merge a descendent, it will replace its
  ancestor). (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

* ``WorkingTreeFormat2.stub_initialize_remote`` is now private.
  (Martin Pool)


bzr 1.5
#######

:Released: 2008-05-16

This release of Bazaar includes several updates to the documentation, and fixes
to prepare for making rich root support the default format. Many bugs have been
squashed, including fixes to log, bzr+ssh inter-operation with older servers.

Changes
*******

* Suppress deprecation warnings when bzrlib is a 'final' release. This way
  users of packaged software won't be bothered with DeprecationWarnings,
  but developers and testers will still see them. (John Arbash Meinel)

Documentation
*************

* Incorporate feedback from Jelmer Vernooij and Neil Martinsen-Burrell
  on the plugin and integration chapters of the User Guide.
  (Ian Clatworthy)


bzr 1.5rc1
##########

:Released: 2008-05-09

Changes
*******

* Broader support of GNU Emacs mail clients. Set
  ``mail_client=emacsclient`` in your bazaar.conf and ``send`` will pop the
  bundle in a mail buffer according to the value of ``mail-user-agent``
  variable. (Xavier Maillard)

Improvements
************

* Diff now handles revision specs like "branch:" and "submit:" more
  efficiently.  (Aaron Bentley, #202928)

* More friendly error given when attempt to start the smart server
  on an address already in use. (Andrea Corbellini, #200575)

* Pull completes much faster when there is nothing to pull.
  (Aaron Bentley)

Bugfixes
********

* Authentication.conf can define sections without password.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #199440)

* Avoid muttering every time a child update does not cause a progress bar
  update. (John Arbash Meinel, #213771)

* ``Branch.reconcile()`` is now implemented. This allows ``bzr reconcile``
  to fix when a Branch has a non-canonical mainline history. ``bzr check``
  also detects this condition. (John Arbash Meinel, #177855)

* ``bzr log -r ..X bzr://`` was failing, because it was getting a request
  for ``revision_id=None`` which was not a string.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #211661)

* ``bzr commit`` now works with Microsoft's FTP service.
  (Andreas Deininger)

* Catch definitions outside sections in authentication.conf.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #217650)

* Conversion from non-rich-root to rich-root(-pack) updates inventory
  sha1s, even when bundles are used.  (Aaron Bentley, #181391)

* Conversion from non-rich-root to rich-root(-pack) works correctly even
  though search keys are not topologically sorted.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Conversion from non-rich-root to rich-root(-pack) works even when a
  parent revision has a different root id.  (Aaron Bentley, #177874)

* Disable strace testing until strace is fixed (see bug #103133) and emit a
  warning when selftest ends to remind us of leaking tests.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #226769)

* Fetching all revisions from a repository does not cause pack collisions.
  (Robert Collins, Aaron Bentley, #212908)

* Fix error about "attempt to add line-delta in non-delta knit".
  (Andrew Bennetts, #217701)

* Pushing a branch in "dirstate" format (Branch5) over bzr+ssh would break
  if the remote server was < version 1.2. This was due to a bug in the
  RemoteRepository.get_parent_map() fallback code.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #214894)

* Remove leftover code in ``bzr_branch`` that inappropriately creates
  a ``branch-name`` file in the branch control directory.
  (Martin Pool)

* Set SO_REUSEADDR on server sockets of ``bzr serve`` to avoid problems
  rebinding the socket when starting the server a second time.
  (John Arbash Meinel, Martin Pool, #164288)

* Severe performance degradation in fetching from knit repositories to
  knits and packs due to parsing the entire revisions.kndx on every graph
  walk iteration fixed by using the Repository.get_graph API.  There was
  another regression in knit => knit fetching which re-read the index for
  every revision each side had in common.
  (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)

* When logging the changes to a particular file, there was a bug if there
  were ghosts in the revision ancestry. (John Arbash Meinel, #209948)

* xs4all's ftp server returns a temporary error when trying to list an
  empty directory, rather than returning an empty list. Adding a
  workaround so that we don't get spurious failures.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #215522)

Documentation
*************

* Expanded the User Guide to include new chapters on popular plugins and
  integrating Bazaar into your environment. The *Best practices* chapter
  was renamed to *Miscellaneous topics* as suggested by community
  feedback as well. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Document outlining strategies for TortoiseBzr. (Mark Hammond)

* Improved the documentation on hooks. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Update authentication docs regarding ssh agents.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #183705)

Testing
*******

* Add ``thread_name_suffix`` parameter to SmartTCPServer_for_testing, to
  make it easy to identify which test spawned a thread with an unhandled
  exception. (Andrew Bennetts)

* New ``--debugflag``/``-E`` option to ``bzr selftest`` for setting
  options for debugging tests, these are complementary to the the -D
  options.  The ``-Dselftest_debug`` global option has been replaced by the
  ``-E=allow_debug`` option for selftest. (Andrew Bennetts)

* Parameterised test ids are preserved correctly to aid diagnosis of test
  failures. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* selftest now accepts --starting-with <id> to load only the tests whose id
  starts with the one specified. This greatly speeds up running the test
  suite on a limited set of tests and can be used to run the tests for a
  single module, a single class or even a single test.  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* The test suite modules have been modified to define load_tests() instead
  of test_suite(). That speeds up selective loading (via --load-list)
  significantly and provides many examples on how to migrate (grep for
  load_tests).  (Vincent Ladeuil)

Internals
*********

* ``Hooks.install_hook`` is now deprecated in favour of
  ``Hooks.install_named_hook`` which adds a required ``name`` parameter, to
  avoid having to call ``Hooks.name_hook``. (Daniel Watkins)

* Implement xml8 serializer.  (Aaron Bentley)

* New form ``@deprecated_method(deprecated_in(1, 5, 0))`` for making
  deprecation wrappers.  (Martin Pool)

* ``Repository.revision_parents`` is now deprecated in favour of
  ``Repository.get_parent_map([revid])[revid]``. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* The Python ``assert`` statement is no longer used in Bazaar source, and
  a test checks this.  (Martin Pool)

API Changes
***********

* ``bzrlib.status.show_pending_merges`` requires the repository to be
  locked by the caller. Callers should have been doing it anyway, but it
  will now raise an exception if they do not. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Repository.get_data_stream, Repository.get_data_stream_for_search(),
  Repository.get_deltas_for_revsions(), Repository.revision_trees(),
  Repository.item_keys_introduced_by() no longer take read locks.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``LockableFiles.get_utf8`` and ``.get`` are deprecated, as a start
  towards removing LockableFiles and ``.control_files`` entirely.
  (Martin Pool)

* Methods deprecated prior to 1.1 have been removed.
  (Martin Pool)


bzr 1.4 
#######

:Released: 2008-04-28

This release of Bazaar includes handy improvements to the speed of log and
status, new options for several commands, improved documentation, and better
hooks, including initial code for server-side hooks.  A number of bugs have
been fixed, particularly in interoperability between different formats or
different releases of Bazaar over there network.  There's been substantial
internal work in both the repository and network code to enable new features
and faster performance.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Pushing a branch in "dirstate" format (Branch5) over bzr+ssh would break
  if the remote server was < version 1.2.  This was due to a bug in the
  RemoteRepository.get_parent_map() fallback code.
  (John Arbash Meinel, Andrew Bennetts, #214894)


bzr 1.4rc2
##########

:Released: 2008-04-21

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr log -r ..X bzr://`` was failing, because it was getting a request
  for ``revision_id=None`` which was not a string.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #211661)

* Fixed a bug in handling ghost revisions when logging changes in a
  particular file.  (John Arbash Meinel, #209948)

* Fix error about "attempt to add line-delta in non-delta knit".
  (Andrew Bennetts, #205156)

* Fixed performance degradation in fetching from knit repositories to
  knits and packs due to parsing the entire revisions.kndx on every graph
  walk iteration fixed by using the Repository.get_graph API.  There was
  another regression in knit => knit fetching which re-read the index for
  every revision each side had in common.
  (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)


bzr 1.4rc1
##########

:Released: 2008-04-11

Changes
*******

* bzr main script cannot be imported (Benjamin Peterson)

* On Linux bzr additionally looks for plugins in arch-independent site
  directory. (Toshio Kuratomi)

* The ``set_rh`` branch hook is now deprecated. Please migrate
  any plugins using this hook to use an alternative, e.g.
  ``post_change_branch_tip``. (Ian Clatworthy)

* When a plugin cannot be loaded as the file path is not a valid
  python module name bzr will now strip a ``bzr_`` prefix from the
  front of the suggested name, as many plugins (e.g. bzr-svn)
  want to be installed without this prefix. It is a common mistake
  to have a folder named "bzr-svn" for that plugin, especially
  as this is what bzr branch lp:bzr-svn will give you. (James Westby,
  Andrew Cowie)

* UniqueIntegerBugTracker now appends bug-ids instead of joining
  them to the base URL. Plugins that register bug trackers may
  need a trailing / added to the base URL if one is not already there.
  (James Wesby, Andrew Cowie)

Features
********

* Added start_commit hook for mutable trees. (Jelmer Vernooij, #186422)

* ``status`` now accepts ``--no-pending`` to show the status without
  listing pending merges, which speeds up the command a lot on large
  histories.  (James Westby, #202830)

* New ``post_change_branch_tip`` hook that is called after the
  branch tip is moved but while the branch is still write-locked.
  See the User Reference for signature details.
  (Ian Clatworthy, James Henstridge)

* Reconfigure can convert a branch to be standalone or to use a shared
  repository.  (Aaron Bentley)

Improvements
************

* The smart protocol now has support for setting branches' revision info
  directly.  This should make operations like push slightly faster, and is a
  step towards server-side hooks.  The new request method name is
  ``Branch.set_last_revision_info``.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``bzr commit --fixes`` now recognises "gnome" as a tag by default.
  (James Westby, Andrew Cowie)

* ``bzr switch`` will attempt to find branches to switch to relative to the
  current branch. E.g. ``bzr switch branchname`` will look for
  ``current_branch/../branchname``. (Robert Collins, Jelmer Vernooij,
  Wouter van Heyst)

* Diff is now more specific about execute-bit changes it describes
  (Chad Miller)

* Fetching data over HTTP is a bit faster when urllib is used.  This is done
  by forcing it to recv 64k at a time when reading lines in HTTP headers,
  rather than just 1 byte at a time.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Log --short and --line are much faster when -r is not specified.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Merge is faster.  We no longer check a file's existence unnecessarily
  when merging the execute bit.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr status`` on an explicit list of files no longer shows pending
  merges, making it much faster on large trees. (John Arbash Meinel)

* The launchpad directory service now warns the user if they have not set
  their launchpad login and are trying to resolve a URL using it, just
  in case they want to do a write operation with it.  (James Westby)

* The smart protocol client is slightly faster, because it now only queries
  the server for the protocol version once per connection.  Also, the HTTP
  transport will now automatically probe for and use a smart server if
  one is present.  You can use the new ``nosmart+`` transport decorator
  to get the old behaviour.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* The ``version`` command takes a ``--short`` option to print just the
  version number, for easier use in scripts.  (Martin Pool)

* Various operations with revision specs and commands that calculate
  revnos and revision ids are faster.  (John A. Meinel, Aaron Bentley)

Bugfixes
********

* Add ``root_client_path`` parameter to SmartWSGIApp and
  SmartServerRequest.  This makes it possible to publish filesystem
  locations that don't exactly match URL paths. SmartServerRequest
  subclasses should use the new ``translate_client_path`` and
  ``transport_from_client_path`` methods when dealing with paths received
  from a client to take this into account.  (Andrew Bennetts, #124089)

* ``bzr mv a b`` can be now used also to rename previously renamed
  directories, not only files. (Lukáš Lalinský, #107967)

* ``bzr uncommit --local`` can now remove revisions from the local
  branch to be symmetric with ``bzr commit --local``.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #93412)

* Don't ask for a password if there is no real terminal.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #69851)

* Fix a bug causing a ValueError crash in ``parse_line_delta_iter`` when
  fetching revisions from a knit to pack repository or vice versa using
  bzr:// (including over http or ssh).
  (#208418, Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool, Robert Collins)

* Fixed ``_get_line`` in ``bzrlib.smart.medium``, which was buggy.  Also
  fixed ``_get_bytes`` in the same module to use the push back buffer.
  These bugs had no known impact in normal use, but were problematic for
  developers working on the code, and were likely to cause real bugs sooner
  or later.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Implement handling of basename parameter for DefaultMail.  (James Westby)

* Incompatibility with Paramiko versions newer than 1.7.2 was fixed.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #213425)

* Launchpad locations (lp: URLs) can be pulled.  (Aaron Bentley, #181945)

* Merges that add files to deleted root directories complete.  They
  do create conflicts.  (Aaron Bentley, #210092)

* vsftp's return ``550 RNFR command failed.`` supported.
  (Marcus Trautwig, #129786)

Documentation
*************

* Improved documentation on send/merge relationship. (Peter Schuller)

* Minor fixes to the User Guide. (Matthew Fuller)

* Reduced the evangelism in the User Guide. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Added Integrating with Bazaar document for developers (Martin Albisetti)

API Breaks
**********

* Attempting to pull data from a ghost aware repository (e.g. knits) into a
  non-ghost aware repository such as weaves will now fail if there are
  ghosts.  (Robert Collins)

* ``KnitVersionedFile`` no longer accepts an ``access_mode`` parameter, and
  now requires the ``index`` and ``access_method`` parameters to be
  supplied. A compatible shim has been kept in the new function
  ``knit.make_file_knit``. (Robert Collins)

* Log formatters must now provide log_revision instead of show and
  show_merge_revno methods. The latter had been deprecated since the 0.17
  release. (James Westby)

* ``LoopbackSFTP`` is now called ``SocketAsChannelAdapter``.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``osutils.backup_file`` is removed. (Alexander Belchenko)

* ``Repository.get_revision_graph`` is deprecated, with no replacement
  method. The method was size(history) and not desirable. (Robert Collins)

* ``revision.revision_graph`` is deprecated, with no replacement function.
  The function was size(history) and not desirable. (Robert Collins)

* ``Transport.get_shared_medium`` is deprecated.  Use
  ``Transport.get_smart_medium`` instead.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``VersionedFile`` factories now accept a get_scope parameter rather
  than using a call to ``transaction_finished``, allowing the removal of
  the fixed list of versioned files per repository. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.annotate_iter`` is deprecated. While in principle this
  allowed lower memory use, all users of annotations wanted full file
  annotations, and there is no storage format suitable for incremental
  line-by-line annotation. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.clone_text`` is deprecated. This performance optimisation
  is no longer used - reading the content of a file that is undergoing a
  file level merge to identical state on two branches is rare enough, and
  not expensive enough to special case. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.clear_cache`` and ``enable_cache`` are deprecated.
  These methods added significant complexity to the ``VersionedFile``
  implementation, but were only used for optimising fetches from knits -
  which can be done from outside the knit layer, or via a caching
  decorator. As knits are not the default format, the complexity is no
  longer worth paying. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.create_empty`` is removed. This method presupposed a
  sensible mapping to a transport for individual files, but pack backed
  versioned files have no such mapping. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.get_graph`` is deprecated, with no replacement method.
  The method was size(history) and not desirable. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.get_graph_with_ghosts`` is deprecated, with no
  replacement method.  The method was size(history) and not desirable.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.get_parents`` is deprecated, please use
  ``VersionedFile.get_parent_map``. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.get_sha1`` is deprecated, please use
  ``VersionedFile.get_sha1s``. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.has_ghost`` is now deprecated, as it is both expensive
  and unused outside of a single test. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.iter_parents`` is now deprecated in favour of
  ``get_parent_map`` which can be used to instantiate a Graph on a
  VersionedFile. (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFileStore`` no longer uses the transaction parameter given
  to most methods; amongst other things this means that the
  get_weave_or_empty method no longer guarantees errors on a missing weave
  in a readonly transaction, and no longer caches versioned file instances
  which reduces memory pressure (but requires more careful management by
  callers to preserve performance). (Robert Collins)

Testing
*******

* New -Dselftest_debug flag disables clearing of the debug flags during
  tests.  This is useful if you want to use e.g. -Dhpss to help debug a
  failing test.  Be aware that using this feature is likely to cause
  spurious test failures if used with the full suite. (Andrew Bennetts)

* selftest --load-list now uses a new more agressive test loader that will
  avoid loading unneeded modules and building their tests. Plugins can use
  this new loader by defining a load_tests function instead of a test_suite
  function. (a forthcoming patch will provide many examples on how to
  implement this).
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* selftest --load-list now does some sanity checks regarding duplicate test
  IDs and tests present in the list but not found in the actual test suite.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Slightly more concise format for the selftest progress bar, so there's
  more space to show the test name.  (Martin Pool) ::

    [2500/10884, 1fail, 3miss in 1m29s] test_revisionnamespaces.TestRev

* The test suite takes much less memory to run, and is a bit faster.  This
  is done by clearing most attributes of TestCases after running them, if
  they succeeded.  (Andrew Bennetts)

Internals
*********

* Added ``_build_client_protocol`` to ``_SmartClient``.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Added basic infrastructure for automatic plugin suggestion.
  (Martin Albisetti)

* If a ``LockableFiles`` object is not explicitly unlocked (for example
  because of a missing ``try/finally`` block, it will give a warning but
  not automatically unlock itself.  (Previously they did.)  This
  sometimes caused knock-on errors if for example the network connection
  had already failed, and should not be relied upon by code.
  (Martin Pool, #109520)

* ``make dist`` target to build a release tarball, and also
  ``check-dist-tarball`` and ``dist-upload-escudero``.  (Martin Pool)

* The ``read_response_tuple`` method of ``SmartClientRequestProtocol*``
  classes will now raise ``UnknownSmartMethod`` when appropriate, so that
  callers don't need to try distinguish unknown request errors from other
  errors.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``set_make_working_trees`` is now implemented provided on all repository
  implementations (Aaron Bentley)

* ``VersionedFile`` now has a new method ``get_parent_map`` which, like
  ``Graph.get_parent_map`` returns a dict of key:parents. (Robert Collins)


bzr 1.3.1
#########

:Released: 2008-04-09

No changes from 1.3.1rc1.


bzr 1.3.1rc1
############

:Released: 2008-04-04

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix a bug causing a ValueError crash in ``parse_line_delta_iter`` when
  fetching revisions from a knit to pack repository or vice versa using
  bzr:// (including over http or ssh).
  (#208418, Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool, Robert Collins)


bzr 1.3
#######

:Released: 2008-03-20

Bazaar has become part of the GNU project <http://www.gnu.org>

Many operations that act on history, including ``log`` and ``annotate`` are now
substantially faster.  Several bugs have been fixed and several new options and
features have been added.

Testing
*******

* Avoid spurious failure of ``TestVersion.test_version`` matching
  directory names.
  (#202778, Martin Pool)


bzr 1.3rc1
##########

:Released: 2008-03-16

Notes When Upgrading
********************

* The backup directory created by ``upgrade`` is now called
  ``backup.bzr``, not ``.bzr.backup``. (Martin Albisetti)

Changes
*******

* A new repository format 'development' has been added. This format will
  represent the latest 'in-progress' format that the bzr developers are
  interested in getting early-adopter testing and feedback on.
  ``doc/developers/development-repo.txt`` has detailed information.
  (Robert Collins)

* BZR_LOG environment variable controls location of .bzr.log trace file.
  User can suppress writing messages to .bzr.log by using '/dev/null'
  filename (on Linux) or 'NUL' (on Windows). If BZR_LOG variable
  is not defined but BZR_HOME is defined then default location
  for .bzr.log trace file is ``$BZR_HOME/.bzr.log``.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #106117)

* ``launchpad`` builtin plugin now shipped as separate part in standalone
  bzr.exe, installed to ``C:\Program Files\Bazaar\plugins`` directory,
  and standalone installer allows user to skip installation of this plugin.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

* Restore auto-detection of plink.exe on Windows. (Dmitry Vasiliev)

* Version number is now shown as "1.2" or "1.2pr2", without zeroed or
  missing final fields.  (Martin Pool)

Features
********

* ``branch`` and ``checkout`` can hard-link working tree files, which is
  faster and saves space.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr send`` will now also look at the ``child_submit_to`` setting in
  the submit branch to determine the email address to send to.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

Improvements
************

* BzrBranch._lefthand_history is faster on pack repos.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Branch6.generate_revision_history is faster.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Directory services can now be registered, allowing special URLs to be
  dereferenced into real URLs.  This is a generalization and cleanup of
  the lp: transport lookup.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Merge directives that are automatically attached to emails have nicer
  filenames, based on branch-nick + revno. (Aaron Bentley)

* ``push`` has a ``--revision`` option, to specify what revision to push up
  to.  (Daniel Watkins)

* Significantly reducing execution time and network traffic for trivial
  case of running ``bzr missing`` command for two identical branches.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

* Speed up operations that look at the revision graph (such as 'bzr log').
  ``KnitPackRepositor.get_revision_graph`` uses ``Graph.iter_ancestry`` to
  extract the revision history. This allows filtering ghosts while
  stepping instead of needing to peek ahead. (John Arbash Meinel)

* The ``hooks`` command lists installed hooks, to assist in debugging.
  (Daniel Watkins)

* Updates to how ``annotate`` work. Should see a measurable improvement in
  performance and memory consumption for file with a lot of merges.
  Also, correctly handle when a line is introduced by both parents (it
  should be attributed to the first merge which notices this, and not
  to all subsequent merges.) (John Arbash Meinel)

Bugfixes
********

* Autopacking no longer holds the full set of inventory lines in
  memory while copying. For large repositories, this can amount to
  hundreds of MB of ram consumption.
  (Ian Clatworthy, John Arbash Meinel)

* Cherrypicking when using ``--format=merge3`` now explictly excludes
  BASE lines. (John Arbash Meinel, #151731)

* Disable plink's interactive prompt for password.
  (#107593, Dmitry Vasiliev)

* Encode command line arguments from unicode to user_encoding before
  invoking external mail client in `bzr send` command.
  (#139318, Alexander Belchenko)

* Fixed problem connecting to ``bzr+https://`` servers.
  (#198793, John Ferlito)

* Improved error reporting in the Launchpad plugin. (Daniel Watkins,
  #196618)

* Include quick-start-summary.svg file to python-based installer(s)
  for Windows. (#192924, Alexander Belchenko)

* lca merge now respects specified files. (Aaron Bentley)

* Make version-info --custom imply --all. (#195560, James Westby)

* ``merge --preview`` now works for merges that add or modify
  symlinks (James Henstridge)

* Redirecting the output from ``bzr merge`` (when the remembered
  location is used) now works. (John Arbash Meinel)

* setup.py script explicitly checks for Python version.
  (Jari Aalto, Alexander Belchenko, #200569)

* UnknownFormatErrors no longer refer to branches regardless of kind of
  unknown format. (Daniel Watkins, #173980)

* Upgrade bundled ConfigObj to version 4.5.2, which properly quotes #
  signs, among other small improvements. (Matt Nordhoff, #86838)

* Use correct indices when emitting LCA conflicts.  This fixes IndexError
  errors.  (Aaron Bentley, #196780)

Documentation
*************

* Explained how to use ``version-info --custom`` in the User Guide.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

API Breaks
**********

* Support for loading plugins from zip files and
  ``bzrlib.plugin.load_from_zip()`` function are deprecated.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

Testing
*******

* Added missing blackbox tests for ``modified`` (Adrian Wilkins)

* The branch interface tests were invalid for branches using rich-root
  repositories because the empty string is not a valid file-id.
  (Robert Collins)

Internals
*********

* ``Graph.iter_ancestry`` returns the ancestry of revision ids. Similar to
  ``Repository.get_revision_graph()`` except it includes ghosts and you can
  stop part-way through. (John Arbash Meinel)

* New module ``tools/package_mf.py`` provide custom module finder for
  python packages (improves standard python library's modulefinder.py)
  used by ``setup.py`` script while building standalone bzr.exe.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

* New remote method ``RemoteBzrDir.find_repositoryV2`` adding support for
  detecting external lookup support on remote repositories. This method is
  now attempted first when lookup up repositories, leading to an extra
  round trip on older bzr smart servers. (Robert Collins)

* Repository formats have a new supported-feature attribute
  ``supports_external_lookups`` used to indicate repositories which support
  falling back to other repositories when they have partial data.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``Repository.get_revision_graph_with_ghosts`` and
  ``bzrlib.revision.(common_ancestor,MultipleRevisionSources,common_graph)``
  have been deprecated.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``Tree.iter_changes`` is now a public API, replacing the work-in-progress
  ``Tree._iter_changes``. The api is now considered stable and ready for
  external users.  (Aaron Bentley)

* The bzrdir format registry now accepts an ``alias`` keyword to
  register_metadir, used to indicate that a format name is an alias for
  some other format and thus should not be reported when describing the
  format. (Robert Collins)


bzr 1.2
#######

:Released: 2008-02-15

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix failing test in Launchpad plugin. (Martin Pool)


bzr 1.2rc1
##########

:Released: 2008-02-13

Notes When Upgrading
********************

* Fetching via the smart protocol may need to reconnect once during a fetch
  if the remote server is running Bazaar 1.1 or earlier, because the client
  attempts to use more efficient requests that confuse older servers.  You
  may be required to re-enter a password or passphrase when this happens.
  This won't happen if the server is upgraded to Bazaar 1.2.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

Changes
*******

* Fetching via bzr+ssh will no longer fill ghosts by default (this is
  consistent with pack-0.92 fetching over SFTP). (Robert Collins)

* Formatting of ``bzr plugins`` output is changed to be more human-
  friendly. Full path of plugins locations will be shown only with
  ``--verbose`` command-line option. (Alexander Belchenko)

* ``merge`` now prefers to use the submit branch, but will fall back to
  parent branch.  For many users, this has no effect.  But some users who
  pull and merge on the same branch will notice a change.  This change
  makes it easier to work on a branch on two different machines, pulling
  between the machines, while merging from the upstream.
  ``merge --remember`` can now be used to set the submit_branch.
  (Aaron Bentley)

Features
********

* ``merge --preview`` produces a diff of the changes merge would make,
  but does not actually perform the merge.  (Aaron Bentley)

* New smart method ``Repository.get_parent_map`` for getting revision
  parent data. This returns additional parent information topologically
  adjacent to the requested data to reduce round trip latency impacts.
  (Robert Collins)

* New smart method, ``Repository.stream_revisions_chunked``, for fetching
  revision data that streams revision data via a chunked encoding.  This
  avoids buffering large amounts of revision data on the server and on the
  client, and sends less data to the server to request the revisions.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins, #178353)

* The launchpad plugin now handles lp urls of the form
  ``lp://staging/``, ``lp://demo/``, ``lp://dev/`` to use the appropriate
  launchpad instance to do the resolution of the branch identities.
  This is primarily of use to Launchpad developers, but can also
  be used by other users who want to try out Launchpad as
  a branch location without messing up their public Launchpad
  account.  Branches that are pushed to the staging environment
  have an expected lifetime of one day. (Tim Penhey)

Improvements
************

* Creating a new branch no longer tries to read the entire revision-history
  unnecessarily over smart server operations. (Robert Collins)

* Fetching between different repository formats with compatible models now
  takes advantage of the smart method to stream revisions.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* The ``--coverage`` option is now global, rather specific to ``bzr
  selftest``.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* The ``register-branch`` command will now use the public url of the branch
  containing the current directory, if one has been set and no explicit
  branch is provided.  (Robert Collins)

* Tweak the ``reannotate`` code path to optimize the 2-parent case.
  Speeds up ``bzr annotate`` with a pack repository by approx 3:2.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

Bugfixes
********

* Calculate remote path relative to the shared medium in _SmartClient.  This
  is related to the problem in bug #124089.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Cleanly handle connection errors in smart protocol version two, the same
  way as they are handled by version one.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Clearer error when ``version-info --custom`` is used without
  ``--template`` (Lukáš Lalinský)

* Don't raise UnavailableFeature during test setup when medusa is not
  available or tearDown is never called leading to nasty side effects.
  (#137823, Vincent Ladeuil)

* If a plugin's test suite cannot be loaded, for example because of a syntax
  error in the tests, then ``selftest`` fails, rather than just printing
  a warning.  (Martin Pool, #189771)

* List possible values for BZR_SSH environment variable in env-variables
  help topic. (Alexander Belchenko, #181842)

* New methods ``push_log_file`` and ``pop_log_file`` to intercept messages:
  popping the log redirection now precisely restores the previous state,
  which makes it easier to use bzr log output from other programs.
  TestCaseInTempDir no longer depends on a log redirection being established
  by the test framework, which lets bzr tests cleanly run from a normal
  unittest runner.
  (#124153, #124849, Martin Pool, Jonathan Lange)

* ``pull --quiet`` is now more quiet, in particular a message is no longer
  printed when the remembered pull location is used. (James Westby,
  #185907)

* ``reconfigure`` can safely be interrupted while fetching.
  (Aaron Bentley, #179316)

* ``reconfigure`` preserves tags when converting to and from lightweight
  checkouts.  (Aaron Bentley, #182040)

* Stop polluting /tmp when running selftest.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #123623)

* Switch from NFKC => NFC for normalization checks. NFC allows a few
  more characters which should be considered valid.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #185458)

* The launchpad plugin now uses the ``edge`` xmlrpc server to avoid
  interacting badly with a bug on the launchpad side. (Robert Collins)

* Unknown hostnames when connecting to a ``bzr://`` URL no longer cause
  tracebacks.  (Andrew Bennetts, #182849)

API Breaks
**********

* Classes implementing Merge types like Merge3Merger must now accept (and
  honour) a do_merge flag in their constructor.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``Repository.add_inventory`` and ``add_revision`` now require the caller
  to previously take a write lock (and start a write group.)
  (Martin Pool)

Testing
*******

* selftest now accepts --load-list <file> to load a test id list. This
  speeds up running the test suite on a limited set of tests.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

Internals
*********

* Add a new method ``get_result`` to graph search objects. The resulting
  ``SearchResult`` can be used to recreate the search later, which will
  be useful in reducing network traffic. (Robert Collins)

* Use convenience function to check whether two repository handles
  are referring to the same repository in ``Repository.get_graph``.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #187162)

* Fetching now passes the find_ghosts flag through to the
  ``InterRepository.missing_revision_ids`` call consistently for all
  repository types. This will enable faster missing revision discovery with
  bzr+ssh. (Robert Collins)

* Fix error handling in Repository.insert_data_stream. (Lukas Lalinsky)

* ``InterRepository.missing_revision_ids`` is now deprecated in favour of
  ``InterRepository.search_missing_revision_ids`` which returns a
  ``bzrlib.graph.SearchResult`` suitable for making requests from the smart
  server. (Robert Collins)

* New error ``NoPublicBranch`` for commands that need a public branch to
  operate. (Robert Collins)

* New method ``iter_inventories`` on Repository for access to many
  inventories. This is primarily used by the ``revision_trees`` method, as
  direct access to inventories is discouraged. (Robert Collins)

* New method ``next_with_ghosts`` on the Graph breadth-first-search objects
  which will split out ghosts and present parents into two separate sets,
  useful for code which needs to be aware of ghosts (e.g. fetching data
  cares about ghosts during revision selection). (Robert Collins)

* Record a timestamp against each mutter to the trace file, relative to the
  first import of bzrlib.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``Repository.get_data_stream`` is now deprecated in favour of
  ``Repository.get_data_stream_for_search`` which allows less network
  traffic when requesting data streams over a smart server. (Robert Collins)

* ``RemoteBzrDir._get_tree_branch`` no longer triggers ``_ensure_real``,
  removing one round trip on many network operations. (Robert Collins)

* RemoteTransport's ``recommended_page_size`` method now returns 64k, like
  SFTPTransport and HttpTransportBase.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Repository has a new method ``has_revisions`` which signals the presence
  of many revisions by returning a set of the revisions listed which are
  present. This can be done by index queries without reading data for parent
  revision names etc. (Robert Collins)


bzr 1.1
#######

:Released: 2008-01-15

(no changes from 1.1rc1)

bzr 1.1rc1
##########

:Released: 2008-01-05

Changes
*******

* Dotted revision numbers have been revised. Instead of growing longer with
  nested branches the branch number just increases. (eg instead of 1.1.1.1.1
  we now report 1.2.1.) This helps scale long lived branches which have many
  feature branches merged between them. (John Arbash Meinel)

* The syntax ``bzr diff branch1 branch2`` is no longer supported.
  Use ``bzr diff branch1 --new branch2`` instead. This change has
  been made to remove the ambiguity where ``branch2`` is in fact a
  specific file to diff within ``branch1``.

Features
********

* New option to use custom template-based formats in  ``bzr version-info``.
  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* diff '--using' allows an external diff tool to be used for files.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* New "lca" merge-type for fast everyday merging that also supports
  criss-cross merges.  (Aaron Bentley)

Improvements
************

* ``annotate`` now doesn't require a working tree. (Lukáš Lalinský,
  #90049)

* ``branch`` and ``checkout`` can now use files from a working tree to
  to speed up the process.  For checkout, this requires the new
  --files-from flag.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr diff`` now sorts files in alphabetical order.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr diff`` now works on branches without working trees. Tree-less
  branches can also be compared to each other and to working trees using
  the new diff options ``--old`` and ``--new``. Diffing between branches,
  with or without trees, now supports specific file filtering as well.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #6700)

* ``bzr pack`` now orders revision texts in topological order, with newest
  at the start of the file, promoting linear reads for ``bzr log`` and the
  like. This partially fixes #154129. (Robert Collins)

* Merge directives now fetch prerequisites from the target branch if
  needed.  (Aaron Bentley)

* pycurl now handles digest authentication.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``reconfigure`` can now convert from repositories.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``-l`` is now a short form for ``--limit`` in ``log``.  (Matt Nordhoff)

* ``merge`` now warns when merge directives cause cherrypicks.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``split`` now supported, to enable splitting large trees into smaller
  pieces.  (Aaron Bentley)

Bugfixes
********

* Avoid AttributeError when unlocking a pack repository when an error occurs.
  (Martin Pool, #180208)

* Better handle short reads when processing multiple range requests.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #179368)

* build_tree acceleration uses the correct path when a file has been moved.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``commit`` now succeeds when a checkout and its master branch share a
  repository.  (Aaron Bentley, #177592)

* Fixed error reporting of unsupported timezone format in
  ``log --timezone``. (Lukáš Lalinský, #178722)

* Fixed Unicode encoding error in ``ignored`` when the output is
  redirected to a pipe. (Lukáš Lalinský)

* Fix traceback when sending large response bodies over the smart protocol
  on Windows. (Andrew Bennetts, #115781)

* Fix ``urlutils.relative_url`` for the case of two ``file:///`` URLs
  pointed to different logical drives on Windows.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #90847)

* HTTP test servers are now compatible with the http protocol version 1.1.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #175524)

* _KnitParentsProvider.get_parent_map now handles requests for ghosts
  correctly, instead of erroring or attributing incorrect parents to ghosts.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``merge --weave --uncommitted`` now works.  (Aaron Bentley)

* pycurl authentication handling was broken and incomplete. Fix handling of
  user:pass embedded in the urls.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #177643)

* Files inside non-directories are now handled like other conflict types.
  (Aaron Bentley, #177390)

* ``reconfigure`` is able to convert trees into lightweight checkouts.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Reduce lockdir timeout to 0 when running ``bzr serve``.  (Andrew Bennetts,
  #148087)

* Test that the old ``version_info_format`` functions still work, even
  though they are deprecated. (John Arbash Meinel, ShenMaq, #177872)

* Transform failures no longer cause ImmortalLimbo errors (Aaron Bentley,
  #137681)

* ``uncommit`` works even when the commit messages of revisions to be
  removed use characters not supported in the terminal encoding.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* When dumb http servers return whole files instead of the requested ranges,
  read the remaining bytes by chunks to avoid overflowing network buffers.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #175886)

Documentation
*************

* Minor tweaks made to the bug tracker integration documentation.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Reference material has now be moved out of the User Guide and added
  to the User Reference. The User Reference has gained 4 sections as
  a result: Authenication Settings, Configuration Settings, Conflicts
  and Hooks. All help topics are now dumped into text format in the
  doc/en/user-reference directory for those who like browsing that
  information in their editor. (Ian Clatworthy)

* *Using Bazaar with Launchpad* tutorial added. (Ian Clatworthy)

Internals
*********

* find_* methods available for BzrDirs, Branches and WorkingTrees.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Help topics can now be loaded from files.
  (Ian Clatworthy, Alexander Belchenko)

* get_parent_map now always provides tuples as its output.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Parent Providers should now implement ``get_parent_map`` returning a
  dictionary instead of ``get_parents`` returning a list.
  ``Graph.get_parents`` is now deprecated. (John Arbash Meinel,
  Robert Collins)

* Patience Diff now supports arbitrary python objects, as long as they
  support ``hash()``. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Reduce selftest overhead to establish test names by memoization.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

API Breaks
**********

Testing
*******

* Modules can now customise their tests by defining a ``load_tests``
  attribute. ``pydoc bzrlib.tests.TestUtil.TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule``
  for the documentation on this attribute. (Robert Collins)

* New helper function ``bzrlib.tests.condition_id_re`` which helps
  filter tests based on a regular expression search on the tests id.
  (Robert Collins)

* New helper function ``bzrlib.tests.condition_isinstance`` which helps
  filter tests based on class. (Robert Collins)

* New helper function ``bzrlib.tests.exclude_suite_by_condition`` which
  generalises the ``exclude_suite_by_re`` function. (Robert Collins)

* New helper function ``bzrlib.tests.filter_suite_by_condition`` which
  generalises the ``filter_suite_by_re`` function. (Robert Collins)

* New helper method ``bzrlib.tests.exclude_tests_by_re`` which gives a new
  TestSuite that does not contain tests from the input that matched a
  regular expression. (Robert Collins)

* New helper method ``bzrlib.tests.randomize_suite`` which returns a
  randomized copy of the input suite. (Robert Collins)

* New helper method ``bzrlib.tests.split_suite_by_re`` which splits a test
  suite into two according to a regular expression. (Robert Collins)

* Parametrize all http tests for the transport implementations, the http
  protocol versions (1.0 and 1.1) and the authentication schemes.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* The ``exclude_pattern`` and ``random_order`` parameters to the function
  ``bzrlib.tests.filter_suite_by_re`` have been deprecated. (Robert Collins)

* The method ``bzrlib.tests.sort_suite_by_re`` has been deprecated. It is
  replaced by the new helper methods added in this release. (Robert Collins)

bzr 1.0rc3
##########

:Released: 2007-12-11

Changes
*******

* If a traceback occurs, users are now asked to report the bug
  through Launchpad (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr/), rather than
  by mail to the mailing list.
  (Martin Pool)

Bugfixes
********

* Fix Makefile rules for doc generation. (Ian Clatworthy, #175207)

* Give more feedback during long http downloads by making readv deliver data
  as it arrives for urllib, and issue more requests for pycurl. High latency
  networks are better handled by urllib, the pycurl implementation give more
  feedback but also incur more latency.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #173010)

* Implement _make_parents_provider on RemoteRepository, allowing generating
  bundles against branches on a smart server.  (Andrew Bennetts, #147836)

Documentation
*************

* Improved user guide.  (Ian Clatworthy)

* The single-page quick reference guide is now available as a PDF.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

Internals
*********

* readv urllib http implementation is now a real iterator above the
  underlying socket and deliver data as soon as it arrives. 'get' still
  wraps its output in a StringIO.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)


bzr 1.0rc2
##########

:Released: 2007-12-07

Improvements
************

* Added a --coverage option to selftest. (Andrew Bennetts)

* Annotate merge (merge-type=weave) now supports cherrypicking.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr commit`` now doesn't print the revision number twice. (Matt
  Nordhoff, #172612)

* New configuration option ``bugtracker_<tracker_abbrevation>_url`` to
  define locations of bug trackers that are not directly supported by
  bzr or a plugin. The URL will be treated as a template and ``{id}``
  placeholders will be replaced by specific bug IDs.  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* Support logging single merge revisions with short and line log formatters.
  (Kent Gibson)

* User Guide enhanced with suggested readability improvements from
  Matt Revell and corrections from John Arbash Meinel. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Quick Start Guide renamed to Quick Start Card, moved down in
  the catalog, provided in pdf and png format and updated to refer
  to ``send`` instead of ``bundle``. (Ian Clatworthy, #165080)

* ``switch`` can now be used on heavyweight checkouts as well as
  lightweight ones. After switching a heavyweight checkout, the
  local branch is a mirror/cache of the new bound branch and
  uncommitted changes in the working tree are merged. As a safety
  check, if there are local commits in a checkout which have not
  been committed to the previously bound branch, then ``switch``
  fails unless the ``--force`` option is given. This option is
  now also required if the branch a lightweight checkout is pointing
  to has been moved. (Ian Clatworthy)

Internals
*********

* New -Dhttp debug option reports http connections, requests and responses.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* New -Dmerge debug option, which emits merge plans for merge-type=weave.

Bugfixes
********

* Better error message when running ``bzr cat`` on a non-existant branch.
  (Lukáš Lalinský, #133782)

* Catch OSError 17 (file exists) in final phase of tree transform and show
  filename to user.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #111758)

* Catch ShortReadvErrors while using pycurl. Also make readv more robust by
  allowing multiple GET requests to be issued if too many ranges are
  required.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #172701)

* Check for missing basis texts when fetching from packs to packs.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #165290)

* Fall back to showing e-mail in ``log --short/--line`` if the
  committer/author has only e-mail. (Lukáš Lalinský, #157026)

API Breaks
**********

* Deprecate not passing a ``location`` argument to commit reporters'
  ``started`` methods. (Matt Nordhoff)


bzr 1.0rc1
##########

:Released: 2007-11-30

Notes When Upgrading
********************

* The default repository format is now ``pack-0.92``.  This
  default is used when creating new repositories with ``init`` and
  ``init-repo``, and when branching over bzr+ssh or bzr+hpss.
  (See https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/164626)

  This format can be read and written by Bazaar 0.92 and later, and
  data can be transferred to and from older formats.

  To upgrade, please reconcile your repository (``bzr reconcile``), and then
  upgrade (``bzr upgrade``).

  ``pack-0.92`` offers substantially better scaling and performance than the
  previous knits format. Some operations are slower where the code already
  had bad scaling characteristics under knits, the pack format makes such
  operations more visible as part of being more scalable overall. We will
  correct such operations over the coming releases and encourage the filing
  of bugs on any operation which you observe to be slower in a packs
  repository. One particular case that we do not intend to fix is pulling
  data from a pack repository into a knit repository over a high latency
  link;  downgrading such data requires reinsertion of the file texts, and
  this is a classic space/time tradeoff. The current implementation is
  conservative on memory usage because we need to support converting data
  from any tree without problems.
  (Robert Collins, Martin Pool, #164476)

Changes
*******

* Disable detection of plink.exe as possible ssh vendor. Plink vendor
  still available if user selects it explicitly with BZR_SSH environment
  variable. (Alexander Belchenko, workaround for bug #107593)

* The pack format is now accessible as "pack-0.92", or "pack-0.92-subtree"
  to enable the subtree functions (for example, for bzr-svn).
  (Martin Pool)

Features
********

* New ``authentication.conf`` file holding the password or other credentials
  for remote servers. This can be used for ssh, sftp, smtp and other
  supported transports.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* New rich-root and rich-root-pack formats, recording the same data about
  tree roots that's recorded for all other directories.
  (Aaron Bentley, #164639)

* ``pack-0.92`` repositories can now be reconciled.
  (Robert Collins, #154173)

* ``switch`` command added for changing the branch a lightweight checkout
  is associated with and updating the tree to reflect the latest content
  accordingly. This command was previously part of the BzrTools plug-in.
  (Ian Clatworthy, Aaron Bentley, David Allouche)

* ``reconfigure`` command can now convert branches, trees, or checkouts to
  lightweight checkouts.  (Aaron Bentley)

Performance
***********

* Commit updates the state of the working tree via a delta rather than
  supplying entirely new basis trees. For commit of a single specified file
  this reduces the wall clock time for commit by roughly a 30%.
  (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

* Commit with many automatically found deleted paths no longer performs
  linear scanning for the children of those paths during inventory
  iteration. This should fix commit performance blowing out when many such
  paths occur during commit. (Robert Collins, #156491)

* Fetch with pack repositories will no longer read the entire history graph.
  (Robert Collins, #88319)

* Revert takes out an appropriate lock when reverting to a basis tree, and
  does not read the basis inventory twice. (Robert Collins)

* Diff does not require an inventory to be generated on dirstate trees.
  (Aaron Bentley, #149254)

* New annotate merge (--merge-type=weave) implementation is fast on
  versionedfiles withough cached annotations, e.g. pack-0.92.
  (Aaron Bentley)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr merge`` now warns when it encounters a criss-cross merge.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr send`` now doesn't require the target e-mail address to be
  specified on the command line if an interactive e-mail client is used.
  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* ``bzr tags`` now prints the revision number for each tag, instead of
  the revision id, unless --show-ids is passed. In addition, tags can be
  sorted chronologically instead of lexicographically with --sort=time.
  (Adeodato Simó, #120231)

* Windows standalone version of bzr is able to load system-wide plugins from
  "plugins" subdirectory in installation directory. In addition standalone
  installer write to the registry (HKLM\SOFTWARE\Bazaar) useful info
  about paths and bzr version. (Alexander Belchenko, #129298)

  retrying an http request or some programming errors may be masked.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #160012)

* Fix ``bzr rm`` to not delete modified and ignored files.
  (Lukáš Lalinský, #172598)

  formatter doesn't support merge revisions. (Kent Gibson, #148908)

* Fix exception when ScopeReplacer is assigned to before any members have
  been retrieved.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Fix multiple connections during checkout --lightweight.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #159150)

* Fix possible error in insert_data_stream when copying between
  pack repositories over bzr+ssh or bzr+http.
  KnitVersionedFile.get_data_stream now makes sure that requested
  compression parents are sent before any delta hunks that depend
  on them.
  (Martin Pool, #164637)

* Fix typo in limiting offsets coalescing for http, leading to
  whole files being downloaded instead of parts.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #165061)

* FTP server errors don't error in the error handling code.
  (Robert Collins, #161240)

* Give a clearer message when a pull fails because the source needs
  to be reconciled.
  (Martin Pool, #164443)

* It is clearer when a plugin cannot be loaded because of its name, and a
  suggestion for an acceptable name is given. (Daniel Watkins, #103023)

* Leave port as None in transport objects if user doesn't
  specify a port in urls.
  (vincent Ladeuil, #150860)

* Make sure Repository.fetch(self) is properly a no-op for all
  Repository implementations. (John Arbash Meinel, #158333)

* Mark .bzr directories as "hidden" on Windows.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #71147)

* ``merge --uncommitted`` can now operate on a single file.
  (Aaron Bentley, Lukáš Lalinský, #136890)

* Obsolete packs are now cleaned up by pack and autopack operations.
  (Robert Collins, #153789)

* Operations pulling data from a smart server where the underlying
  repositories are not both annotated/both unannotated will now work.
  (Robert Collins, #165304).

* Reconcile now shows progress bars. (Robert Collins, #159351)

* ``RemoteBranch`` was not initializing ``self._revision_id_to_revno_map``
  properly. (John Arbash Meinel, #162486)

* Removing an already-removed file reports the file does not exist. (Daniel
  Watkins, #152811)

* Rename on Windows is able to change filename case.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #77740)

* Return error instead of a traceback for ``bzr log -r0``.
  (Kent Gibson, #133751)

* Return error instead of a traceback when bzr is unable to create
  symlink on some platforms (e.g. on Windows).
  (Alexander Belchenko, workaround for #81689)

* Revert doesn't crash when restoring a single file from a deleted
  directory. (Aaron Bentley)

* Stderr output via logging mechanism now goes through encoded wrapper
  and no more uses utf-8, but terminal encoding instead. So all unicode
  strings now should be readable in non-utf-8 terminal.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #54173)

* The error message when ``move --after`` should be used makes how to do so
  clearer. (Daniel Watkins, #85237)

* Unicode-safe output from ``bzr info``. The output will be encoded
  using the terminal encoding and unrepresentable characters will be
  replaced by '?'. (Lukáš Lalinský, #151844)

* Working trees are no longer created when pushing into a local no-trees
  repo. (Daniel Watkins, #50582)

* Upgrade util/configobj to version 4.4.0.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #151208).

* Wrap medusa ftp test server as an FTPServer feature.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #157752)

API Breaks
**********

* ``osutils.backup_file`` is deprecated. Actually it's not used in bzrlib
  during very long time. (Alexander Belchenko)

* The return value of
  ``VersionedFile.iter_lines_added_or_present_in_versions`` has been
  changed. Previously it was an iterator of lines, now it is an iterator of
  (line, version_id) tuples. This change has been made to aid reconcile and
  fetch operations. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.repository.get_versioned_file_checker`` is now private.
  (Robert Collins)

* The Repository format registry default has been removed; it was previously
  obsoleted by the bzrdir format default, which implies a default repository
  format.
  (Martin Pool)

Internals
*********

* Added ``ContainerSerialiser`` and ``ContainerPushParser`` to
  ``bzrlib.pack``.  These classes provide more convenient APIs for generating
  and parsing containers from streams rather than from files.  (Andrew
  Bennetts)

* New module ``lru_cache`` providing a cache for use by tasks that need
  semi-random access to large amounts of data. (John A Meinel)

* InventoryEntry.diff is now deprecated.  Please use diff.DiffTree instead.


bzr 0.92
########

:Released: 2007-11-05

Changes
*******

  * New uninstaller on Win32.  (Alexander Belchenko)


bzr 0.92rc1
###########

:Released: 2007-10-29

Changes
*******

* ``bzr`` now returns exit code 4 if an internal error occurred, and
  3 if a normal error occurred.  (Martin Pool)

* ``pull``, ``merge`` and ``push`` will no longer silently correct some
  repository index errors that occured as a result of the Weave disk format.
  Instead the ``reconcile`` command needs to be run to correct those
  problems if they exist (and it has been able to fix most such problems
  since bzr 0.8). Some new problems have been identified during this release
  and you should run ``bzr check`` once on every repository to see if you
  need to reconcile. If you cannot ``pull`` or ``merge`` from a remote
  repository due to mismatched parent errors - a symptom of index errors -
  you should simply take a full copy of that remote repository to a clean
  directory outside any local repositories, then run reconcile on it, and
  finally pull from it locally. (And naturally email the repositories owner
  to ask them to upgrade and run reconcile).
  (Robert Collins)

Features
********

* New ``knitpack-experimental`` repository format. This is interoperable with
  the ``dirstate-tags`` format but uses a smarter storage design that greatly
  speeds up many operations, both local and remote. This new format can be
  used as an option to the ``init``, ``init-repository`` and ``upgrade``
  commands. (Robert Collins)

* For users of bzr-svn (and those testing the prototype subtree support) that
  wish to try packs, a new ``knitpack-subtree-experimental`` format has also
  been added. This is interoperable with the ``dirstate-subtrees`` format.
  (Robert Collins)

* New ``reconfigure`` command. (Aaron Bentley)

* New ``revert --forget-merges`` command, which removes the record of a pending
  merge without affecting the working tree contents.  (Martin Pool)

* New ``bzr_remote_path`` configuration variable allows finer control of
  remote bzr locations than BZR_REMOTE_PATH environment variable.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* New ``launchpad-login`` command to tell Bazaar your Launchpad
  user ID.  This can then be used by other functions of the
  Launchpad plugin. (James Henstridge)

Performance
***********

* Commit in quiet mode is now slightly faster as the information to
  output is no longer calculated. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Commit no longer checks for new text keys during insertion when the
  revision id was deterministically unique. (Robert Collins)

* Committing a change which is not a merge and does not change the number of
  files in the tree is faster by utilising the data about whether files are
  changed to determine if the tree is unchanged rather than recalculating
  it at the end of the commit process. (Robert Collins)

* Inventory serialisation no longer double-sha's the content.
  (Robert Collins)

* Knit text reconstruction now avoids making copies of the lines list for
  interim texts when building a single text. The new ``apply_delta`` method
  on ``KnitContent`` aids this by allowing modification of the revision id
  such objects represent. (Robert Collins)

* Pack indices are now partially parsed for specific key lookup using a
  bisection approach. (Robert Collins)

* Partial commits are now approximately 40% faster by walking over the
  unselected current tree more efficiently. (Robert Collins)

* XML inventory serialisation takes 20% less time while being stricter about
  the contents. (Robert Collins)

* Graph ``heads()`` queries have been fixed to no longer access all history
  unnecessarily. (Robert Collins)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr+https://`` smart server across https now supported.
  (John Ferlito, Martin Pool, #128456)

* Mutt is now a supported mail client; set ``mail_client=mutt`` in your
  bazaar.conf and ``send`` will use mutt. (Keir Mierle)

* New option ``-c``/``--change`` for ``merge`` command for cherrypicking
  changes from one revision. (Alexander Belchenko, #141368)

* Show encodings, locale and list of plugins in the traceback message.
  (Martin Pool, #63894)

* Experimental directory formats can now be marked with
  ``experimental = True`` during registration. (Ian Clatworthy)

Documentation
*************

* New *Bazaar in Five Minutes* guide.  (Matthew Revell)

* The hooks reference documentation is now converted to html as expected.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Connection error reporting for the smart server has been fixed to
  display a user friendly message instead of a traceback.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #115601)

* Make sure to use ``O_BINARY`` when opening files to check their
  sha1sum. (Alexander Belchenko, John Arbash Meinel, #153493)

* Fix a problem with Win32 handling of the executable bit.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #149113)

* ``bzr+ssh://`` and ``sftp://`` URLs that do not specify ports explicitly
  no longer assume that means port 22.  This allows people using OpenSSH to
  override the default port in their ``~/.ssh/config`` if they wish.  This
  fixes a bug introduced in bzr 0.91.  (Andrew Bennetts, #146715)

* Commands reporting exceptions can now be profiled and still have their
  data correctly dumped to a file. For example, a ``bzr commit`` with
  no changes still reports the operation as pointless but doing so no
  longer throws away the profiling data if this command is run with
  ``--lsprof-file callgrind.out.ci`` say. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Fallback to ftp when paramiko is not installed and sftp can't be used for
  ``tests/commands`` so that the test suite is still usable without
  paramiko.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #59150)

* Fix commit ordering in corner case. (Aaron Bentley, #94975)

* Fix long standing bug in partial commit when there are renames
  left in tree. (Robert Collins, #140419)

* Fix selftest semi-random noise during http related tests.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #140614)

* Fix typo in ftp.py making the reconnection fail on temporary errors.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #154259)

* Fix failing test by comparing real paths to cover the case where the TMPDIR
  contains a symbolic link.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #141382).

* Fix log against smart server branches that don't support tags.
  (James Westby, #140615)

* Fix pycurl http implementation by defining error codes from
  pycurl instead of relying on an old curl definition.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #147530)

* Fix 'unprintable error' message when displaying BzrCheckError and
  some other exceptions on Python 2.5.
  (Martin Pool, #144633)

* Fix ``Inventory.copy()`` and add test for it. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Handles default value for ListOption in cmd_commit.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #140432)

* HttpServer and FtpServer need to be closed properly or a listening socket
  will remain opened.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #140055)

* Monitor the .bzr directory created in the top level test
  directory to detect leaking tests.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #147986)

* The basename, not the full path, is now used when checking whether
  the profiling dump file begins with ``callgrind.out`` or not. This
  fixes a bug reported by Aaron Bentley on IRC. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Trivial fix for invoking command ``reconfigure`` without arguments.
  (Rob Weir, #141629)

* ``WorkingTree.rename_one`` will now raise an error if normalisation of the
  new path causes bzr to be unable to access the file. (Robert Collins)

* Correctly detect a NoSuchFile when using a filezilla server. (Gary van der
  Merwe)

API Breaks
**********

* ``bzrlib.index.GraphIndex`` now requires a size parameter to the
  constructor, for enabling bisection searches. (Robert Collins)

* ``CommitBuilder.record_entry_contents`` now requires the root entry of a
  tree be supplied to it, previously failing to do so would trigger a
  deprecation warning. (Robert Collins)

* ``KnitVersionedFile.add*`` will no longer cache added records even when
  enable_cache() has been called - the caching feature is now exclusively for
  reading existing data. (Robert Collins)

* ``ReadOnlyLockError`` is deprecated; ``LockFailed`` is usually more
  appropriate.  (Martin Pool)

* Removed ``bzrlib.transport.TransportLogger`` - please see the new
  ``trace+`` transport instead. (Robert Collins)

* Removed previously deprecated varargs interface to ``TestCase.run_bzr`` and
  deprecated methods ``TestCase.capture`` and ``TestCase.run_bzr_captured``.
  (Martin Pool)

* Removed previous deprecated ``basis_knit`` parameter to the
  ``KnitVersionedFile`` constructor. (Robert Collins)

* Special purpose method ``TestCase.run_bzr_decode`` is moved to the test_non_ascii
  class that needs it.
  (Martin Pool)

* The class ``bzrlib.repofmt.knitrepo.KnitRepository3`` has been folded into
  ``KnitRepository`` by parameters to the constructor. (Robert Collins)

* The ``VersionedFile`` interface now allows content checks to be bypassed
  by supplying check_content=False.  This saves nearly 30% of the minimum
  cost to store a version of a file. (Robert Collins)

* Tree's with bad state such as files with no length or sha will no longer
  be silently accepted by the repository XML serialiser. To serialise
  inventories without such data, pass working=True to write_inventory.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``VersionedFile.fix_parents`` has been removed as a harmful API.
  ``VersionedFile.join`` will no longer accept different parents on either
  side of a join - it will either ignore them, or error, depending on the
  implementation. See notes when upgrading for more information.
  (Robert Collins)

Internals
*********

* ``bzrlib.transport.Transport.put_file`` now returns the number of bytes
  put by the method call, to allow avoiding stat-after-write or
  housekeeping in callers. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.xml_serializer.Serializer`` is now responsible for checking that
  mandatory attributes are present on serialisation and deserialisation.
  This fixes some holes in API usage and allows better separation between
  physical storage and object serialisation. (Robert Collins)

* New class ``bzrlib.errors.InternalBzrError`` which is just a convenient
  shorthand for deriving from BzrError and setting internal_error = True.
  (Robert Collins)

* New method ``bzrlib.mutabletree.update_to_one_parent_via_delta`` for
  moving the state of a parent tree to a new version via a delta rather than
  a complete replacement tree. (Robert Collins)

* New method ``bzrlib.osutils.minimum_path_selection`` useful for removing
  duplication from user input, when a user mentions both a path and an item
  contained within that path. (Robert Collins)

* New method ``bzrlib.repository.Repository.is_write_locked`` useful for
  determining if a repository is write locked. (Robert Collins)

* New method on ``bzrlib.tree.Tree`` ``path_content_summary`` provides a
  tuple containing the key information about a path for commit processing
  to complete. (Robert Collins)

* New method on xml serialisers, write_inventory_to_lines, which matches the
  API used by knits for adding content. (Robert Collins)

* New module ``bzrlib.bisect_multi`` with generic multiple-bisection-at-once
  logic, currently only available for byte-based lookup
  (``bisect_multi_bytes``). (Robert Collins)

* New helper ``bzrlib.tuned_gzip.bytes_to_gzip`` which takes a byte string
  and returns a gzipped version of the same. This is used to avoid a bunch
  of api friction during adding of knit hunks. (Robert Collins)

* New parameter on ``bzrlib.transport.Transport.readv``
  ``adjust_for_latency`` which changes readv from returning strictly the
  requested data to inserted return larger ranges and in forward read order
  to reduce the effect of network latency. (Robert Collins)

* New parameter yield_parents on ``Inventory.iter_entries_by_dir`` which
  causes the parents of a selected id to be returned recursively, so all the
  paths from the root down to each element of selected_file_ids are
  returned. (Robert Collins)

* Knit joining has been enhanced to support plain to annotated conversion
  and annotated to plain conversion. (Ian Clatworthy)

* The CommitBuilder method ``record_entry_contents`` now returns summary
  information about the effect of the commit on the repository. This tuple
  contains an inventory delta item if the entry changed from the basis, and a
  boolean indicating whether a new file graph node was recorded.
  (Robert Collins)

* The python path used in the Makefile can now be overridden.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Ian Clatworthy)

Testing
*******

* New transport implementation ``trace+`` which is useful for testing,
  logging activity taken to its _activity attribute. (Robert Collins)

* When running bzr commands within the test suite, internal exceptions are
  not caught and reported in the usual way, but rather allowed to propagate
  up and be visible to the test suite.  A new API ``run_bzr_catch_user_errors``
  makes this behavior available to other users.
  (Martin Pool)

* New method ``TestCase.call_catch_warnings`` for testing methods that
  raises a Python warning.  (Martin Pool)


bzr 0.91
########

:Released: 2007-09-26

Bug Fixes
*********

* Print a warning instead of aborting the ``python setup.py install``
  process if building of a C extension is not possible.
  (Lukáš Lalinský, Alexander Belchenko)

* Fix commit ordering in corner case (Aaron Bentley, #94975)

* Fix ''bzr info bzr://host/'' and other operations on ''bzr://' URLs with
  an implicit port.  We were incorrectly raising PathNotChild due to
  inconsistent treatment of the ''_port'' attribute on the Transport object.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #133965)

* Make RemoteRepository.sprout cope gracefully with servers that don't
  support the ``Repository.tarball`` request.
  (Andrew Bennetts)


bzr 0.91rc2
###########

:Released: 2007-09-11

* Replaced incorrect tarball for previous release; a debug statement was left
  in bzrlib/remote.py.


bzr 0.91rc1
###########

:Released: 2007-09-11

Changes
*******

* The default branch and repository format has changed to
  ``dirstate-tags``, so tag commands are active by default.
  This format is compatible with Bazaar 0.15 and later.
  This incidentally fixes bug #126141.
  (Martin Pool)

* ``--quiet`` or ``-q`` is no longer a global option. If present, it
  must now appear after the command name. Scripts doing things like
  ``bzr -q missing`` need to be rewritten as ``bzr missing -q``.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

Features
********

* New option ``--author`` in ``bzr commit`` to specify the author of the
  change, if it's different from the committer. ``bzr log`` and
  ``bzr annotate`` display the author instead of the committer.
  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* In addition to global options and command specific options, a set of
  standard options are now supported. Standard options are legal for
  all commands. The initial set of standard options are:

  * ``--help`` or ``-h`` - display help message
  * ``--verbose`` or ``-v`` - display additional information
  * ``--quiet``  or ``-q`` - only output warnings and errors.

  Unlike global options, standard options can be used in aliases and
  may have command-specific help. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Verbosity level processing has now been unified. If ``--verbose``
  or ``-v`` is specified on the command line multiple times, the
  verbosity level is made positive the first time then increased.
  If ``--quiet`` or ``-q`` is specified on the command line
  multiple times, the verbosity level is made negative the first
  time then decreased. To get the default verbosity level of zero,
  either specify none of the above , ``--no-verbose`` or ``--no-quiet``.
  Note that most commands currently ignore the magnitude of the
  verbosity level but do respect *quiet vs normal vs verbose* when
  generating output. (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``Branch.hooks`` now supports ``pre_commit`` hook. The hook's signature
  is documented in BranchHooks constructor. (Nam T. Nguyen, #102747)

* New ``Repository.stream_knit_data_for_revisions`` request added to the
  network protocol for greatly reduced roundtrips when retrieving a set of
  revisions. (Andrew Bennetts)

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr plugins`` now lists the version number for each plugin in square
  brackets after the path. (Robert Collins, #125421)

* Pushing, pulling and branching branches with subtree references was not
  copying the subtree weave, preventing the file graph from being accessed
  and causing errors in commits in clones. (Robert Collins)

* Suppress warning "integer argument expected, got float" from Paramiko,
  which sometimes caused false test failures.  (Martin Pool)

* Fix bug in bundle 4 that could cause attempts to write data to wrong
  versionedfile.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Diffs generated using "diff -p" no longer break the patch parser.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* get_transport treats an empty possible_transports list the same as a non-
  empty one.  (Aaron Bentley)

* patch verification for merge directives is reactivated, and works with
  CRLF and CR files.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Accept ..\ as a path in revision specifiers. This fixes for example
  "-r branch:..\other-branch" on Windows.  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* ``BZR_PLUGIN_PATH`` may now contain trailing slashes.
  (Blake Winton, #129299)

* man page no longer lists hidden options (#131667, Aaron Bentley)

* ``uncommit --help`` now explains the -r option adequately.  (Daniel
  Watkins, #106726)

* Error messages are now better formatted with parameters (such as
  filenames) quoted when necessary. This avoids confusion when directory
  names ending in a '.' at the end of messages were confused with a
  full stop that may or not have been there. (Daniel Watkins, #129791)

* Fix ``status FILE -r X..Y``. (Lukáš Lalinský)

* If a particular command is an alias, ``help`` will show the alias
  instead of claiming there is no help for said alias. (Daniel Watkins,
  #133548)

* TreeTransform-based operations, like pull, merge, revert, and branch,
  now roll back if they encounter an error.  (Aaron Bentley, #67699)

* ``bzr commit`` now exits cleanly if a character unsupported by the
  current encoding is used in the commit message.  (Daniel Watkins,
  #116143)

* bzr send uses default values for ranges when only half of an elipsis
  is specified ("-r..5" or "-r5..").  (#61685, Aaron Bentley)

* Avoid trouble when Windows ssh calls itself 'plink' but no plink
  binary is present.  (Martin Albisetti, #107155)

* ``bzr remove`` should remove clean subtrees.  Now it will remove (without
  needing ``--force``) subtrees that contain no files with text changes or
  modified files.  With ``--force`` it removes the subtree regardless of
  text changes or unknown files. Directories with renames in or out (but
  not changed otherwise) will now be removed without needing ``--force``.
  Unknown ignored files will be deleted without needing ``--force``.
  (Marius Kruger, #111665)

* When two plugins conflict, the source of both the losing and now the
  winning definition is shown.  (Konstantin Mikhaylov, #5454)

* When committing to a branch, the location being committed to is
  displayed.  (Daniel Watkins, #52479)

* ``bzr --version`` takes care about encoding of stdout, especially
  when output is redirected. (Alexander Belchenko, #131100)

* Prompt for an ftp password if none is provided.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #137044)

* Reuse bound branch associated transport to avoid multiple
  connections.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #128076, #131396)

* Overwrite conflicting tags by ``push`` and ``pull`` if the
  ``--overwrite`` option is specified.  (Lukáš Lalinský, #93947)

* In checkouts, tags are copied into the master branch when created,
  changed or deleted, and are copied into the checkout when it is
  updated.  (Martin Pool, #93856, #93860)

* Print a warning instead of aborting the ``python setup.py install``
  process if building of a C extension is not possible.
  (Lukáš Lalinský, Alexander Belchenko)

Improvements
************

* Add the option "--show-diff" to the commit command in order to display
  the diff during the commit log creation. (Goffredo Baroncelli)

* ``pull`` and ``merge`` are much faster at installing bundle format 4.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``pull -v`` no longer includes deltas, making it much faster.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``send`` now sends the directive as an attachment by default.
  (Aaron Bentley, Lukáš Lalinský, Alexander Belchenko)

* Documentation updates (Martin Albisetti)

* Help on debug flags is now included in ``help global-options``.
  (Daniel Watkins, #124853)

* Parameters passed on the command line are checked to ensure they are
  supported by the encoding in use. (Daniel Watkins)

* The compression used within the bzr repository has changed from zlib
  level 9 to the zlib default level. This improves commit performance with
  only a small increase in space used (and in some cases a reduction in
  space). (Robert Collins)

* Initial commit no longer SHAs files twice and now reuses the path
  rather than looking it up again, making it faster.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* New option ``-c``/``--change`` for ``diff`` and ``status`` to show
  changes in one revision.  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* If versioned files match a given ignore pattern, a warning is now
  given. (Daniel Watkins, #48623)

* ``bzr status`` now has -S as a short name for --short and -V as a
  short name for --versioned. These have been added to assist users
  migrating from Subversion: ``bzr status -SV`` is now like
  ``svn status -q``.  (Daniel Watkins, #115990)

* Added C implementation of  ``PatienceSequenceMatcher``, which is about
  10x faster than the Python version. This speeds up commands that
  need file diffing, such as ``bzr commit`` or ``bzr diff``.
  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* HACKING has been extended with a large section on core developer tasks.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Add ``branches`` and ``standalone-trees`` as online help topics and
  include them as Concepts within the User Reference.
  (Paul Moore, Ian Clatworthy)

* ``check`` can detect versionedfile parent references that are
  inconsistent with revision and inventory info, and ``reconcile`` can fix
  them.  These faulty references were generated by 0.8-era releases,
  so repositories which were manipulated by old bzrs should be
  checked, and possibly reconciled ASAP.  (Aaron Bentley, Andrew Bennetts)

API Breaks
**********

* ``Branch.append_revision`` is removed altogether; please use
  ``Branch.set_last_revision_info`` instead.  (Martin Pool)

* CommitBuilder now advertises itself as requiring the root entry to be
  supplied. This only affects foreign repository implementations which reuse
  CommitBuilder directly and have changed record_entry_contents to require
  that the root not be supplied. This should be precisely zero plugins
  affected. (Robert Collins)

* The ``add_lines`` methods on ``VersionedFile`` implementations has changed
  its return value to include the sha1 and length of the inserted text. This
  allows the avoidance of double-sha1 calculations during commit.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``Transport.should_cache`` has been removed.  It was not called in the
  previous release.  (Martin Pool)

Testing
*******

* Tests may now raise TestNotApplicable to indicate they shouldn't be
  run in a particular scenario.  (Martin Pool)

* New function multiply_tests_from_modules to give a simpler interface
  to test parameterization.  (Martin Pool, Robert Collins)

* ``Transport.should_cache`` has been removed.  It was not called in the
  previous release.  (Martin Pool)

* NULL_REVISION is returned to indicate the null revision, not None.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Use UTF-8 encoded StringIO for log tests to avoid failures on
  non-ASCII committer names.  (Lukáš Lalinský)

Internals
*********

* ``bzrlib.plugin.all_plugins`` has been deprecated in favour of
  ``bzrlib.plugin.plugins()`` which returns PlugIn objects that provide
  useful functionality for determining the path of a plugin, its tests, and
  its version information. (Robert Collins)

* Add the option user_encoding to the function 'show_diff_trees()'
  in order to move the user encoding at the UI level. (Goffredo Baroncelli)

* Add the function make_commit_message_template_encoded() and the function
  edit_commit_message_encoded() which handle encoded strings.
  This is done in order to mix the commit messages (which is a unicode
  string), and the diff which is a raw string. (Goffredo Baroncelli)

* CommitBuilder now defaults to using add_lines_with_ghosts, reducing
  overhead on non-weave repositories which don't require all parents to be
  present. (Robert Collins)

* Deprecated method ``find_previous_heads`` on
  ``bzrlib.inventory.InventoryEntry``. This has been superseded by the use
  of ``parent_candidates`` and a separate heads check via the repository
  API. (Robert Collins)

* New trace function ``mutter_callsite`` will print out a subset of the
  stack to the log, which can be useful for gathering debug details.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.pack.ContainerWriter`` now tracks how many records have been
  added via a public attribute records_written. (Robert Collins)

* New method ``bzrlib.transport.Transport.get_recommended_page_size``.
  This provides a hint to users of transports as to the reasonable
  minimum data to read. In principle this can take latency and
  bandwidth into account on a per-connection basis, but for now it
  just has hard coded values based on the url. (e.g. http:// has a large
  page size, file:// has a small one.) (Robert Collins)

* New method on ``bzrlib.transport.Transport`` ``open_write_stream`` allows
  incremental addition of data to a file without requiring that all the
  data be buffered in memory. (Robert Collins)

* New methods on ``bzrlib.knit.KnitVersionedFile``:
  ``get_data_stream(versions)``, ``insert_data_stream(stream)`` and
  ``get_format_signature()``.  These provide some infrastructure for
  efficiently streaming the knit data for a set of versions over the smart
  protocol.

* Knits with no annotation cache still produce correct annotations.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Three new methods have been added to ``bzrlib.trace``:
  ``set_verbosity_level``, ``get_verbosity_level`` and ``is_verbose``.
  ``set_verbosity_level`` expects a numeric value: negative for quiet,
  zero for normal, positive for verbose. The size of the number can be
  used to determine just how quiet or verbose the application should be.
  The existing ``be_quiet`` and ``is_quiet`` routines have been
  integrated into this new scheme. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Options can now be delcared with a ``custom_callback`` parameter. If
  set, this routine is called after the option is processed. This feature
  is now used by the standard options ``verbose`` and ``quiet`` so that
  setting one implicitly resets the other. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Rather than declaring a new option from scratch in order to provide
  custom help, a centrally registered option can be decorated using the
  new ``bzrlib.Option.custom_help`` routine. In particular, this routine
  is useful when declaring better help for the ``verbose`` and ``quiet``
  standard options as the base definition of these is now more complex
  than before thanks to their use of a custom callback. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Tree._iter_changes(specific_file=[]) now iterates through no files,
  instead of iterating through all files.  None is used to iterate through
  all files.  (Aaron Bentley)

* WorkingTree.revert() now accepts None to revert all files.  The use of
  [] to revert all files is deprecated.  (Aaron Bentley)


bzr 0.90
########

:Released: 2007-08-28

Improvements
************

* Documentation is now organized into multiple directories with a level
  added for different languages or locales. Added the Mini Tutorial
  and Quick Start Summary (en) documents from the Wiki, improving the
  content and readability of the former. Formatted NEWS as Release Notes
  complete with a Table of Conents, one heading per release. Moved the
  Developer Guide into the main document catalog and provided a link
  from the developer document catalog back to the main one.
  (Ian Clatworthy, Sabin Iacob, Alexander Belchenko)


API Changes
***********

* The static convenience method ``BzrDir.create_repository``
  is deprecated.  Callers should instead create a ``BzrDir`` instance
  and call ``create_repository`` on that.  (Martin Pool)


bzr 0.90rc1
###########

:Released: 2007-08-14

Bugfixes
********

* ``bzr init`` should connect to the remote location one time only.  We
  have been connecting several times because we forget to pass around the
  Transport object. This modifies ``BzrDir.create_branch_convenience``,
  so that we can give it the Transport we already have.
  (John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil, #111702)

* Get rid of sftp connection cache (get rid of the FTP one too).
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #43731)

* bzr branch {local|remote} remote don't try to create a working tree
  anymore.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #112173)

* All identified multiple connections for a single bzr command have been
  fixed. See bzrlib/tests/commands directory.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``bzr rm`` now does not insist on ``--force`` to delete files that
  have been renamed but not otherwise modified.  (Marius Kruger,
  #111664)

* ``bzr selftest --bench`` no longer emits deprecation warnings
  (Lukáš Lalinský)

* ``bzr status`` now honours FILE parameters for conflict lists
  (Aaron Bentley, #127606)

* ``bzr checkout`` now honours -r when reconstituting a working tree.
  It also honours -r 0.  (Aaron Bentley, #127708)

* ``bzr add *`` no more fails on Windows if working tree contains
  non-ascii file names. (Kuno Meyer, #127361)

* allow ``easy_install bzr`` runs without fatal errors.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #125521)

* Graph._filter_candidate_lca does not raise KeyError if a candidate
  is eliminated just before it would normally be examined.  (Aaron Bentley)

* SMTP connection failures produce a nice message, not a traceback.
  (Aaron Bentley)

Improvements
************

* Don't show "dots" progress indicators when run non-interactively, such
  as from cron.  (Martin Pool)

* ``info`` now formats locations more nicely and lists "submit" and
  "public" branches (Aaron Bentley)

* New ``pack`` command that will trigger database compression within
  the repository (Robert Collins)

* Implement ``_KnitIndex._load_data`` in a pyrex extension. The pyrex
  version is approximately 2-3x faster at parsing a ``.kndx`` file.
  Which yields a measurable improvement for commands which have to
  read from the repository, such as a 1s => 0.75s improvement in
  ``bzr diff`` when there are changes to be shown.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Merge is now faster.  Depending on the scenario, it can be more than 2x
  faster. (Aaron Bentley)

* Give a clearer warning, and allow ``python setup.py install`` to
  succeed even if pyrex is not available.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``DirState._read_dirblocks`` now has an optional Pyrex
  implementation. This improves the speed of any command that has to
  read the entire DirState. (``diff``, ``status``, etc, improve by
  about 10%).
  ``bisect_dirblocks`` has also been improved, which helps all
  ``_get_entry`` type calls (whenever we are searching for a
  particular entry in the in-memory DirState).
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr pull`` and ``bzr push`` no longer do a complete walk of the
  branch revision history for ui display unless -v is supplied.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``bzr log -rA..B`` output shifted to the left margin if the log only
  contains merge revisions. (Kent Gibson)

* The ``plugins`` command is now public with improved help.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* New bundle and merge directive formats are faster to generate, and

* Annotate merge now works when there are local changes. (Aaron Bentley)

* Commit now only shows the progress in terms of directories instead of
  entries. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Fix ``KnitRepository.get_revision_graph`` to not request the graph 2
  times. This makes ``get_revision_graph`` 2x faster. (John Arbash
  Meinel)

* Fix ``VersionedFile.get_graph()`` to avoid using
  ``set.difference_update(other)``, which has bad scaling when
  ``other`` is large. This improves ``VF.get_graph([version_id])`` for
  a 12.5k graph from 2.9s down to 200ms. (John Arbash Meinel)

* The ``--lsprof-file`` option now generates output for KCacheGrind if
  the file starts with ``callgrind.out``. This matches the default file
  filtering done by KCacheGrind's Open Dialog. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Fix ``bzr update`` to avoid an unnecessary
  ``branch.get_master_branch`` call, which avoids 1 extra connection
  to the remote server. (Partial fix for #128076, John Arbash Meinel)

* Log errors from the smart server in the trace file, to make debugging
  test failures (and live failures!) easier.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* The HTML version of the man page has been superceded by a more
  comprehensive manual called the Bazaar User Reference. This manual
  is completed generated from the online help topics. As part of this
  change, limited reStructuredText is now explicitly supported in help
  topics and command help with 'unnatural' markup being removed prior
  to display by the online help or inclusion in the man page.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* HTML documentation now use files extension ``*.html``
  (Alexander Belchenko)

* The cache of ignore definitions is now cleared in WorkingTree.unlock()
  so that changes to .bzrignore aren't missed. (#129694, Daniel Watkins)

* ``bzr selftest --strict`` fails if there are any missing features or
  expected test failures. (Daniel Watkins, #111914)

* Link to registration survey added to README. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Windows standalone installer show link to registration survey
  when installation finished. (Alexander Belchenko)

Library API Breaks
******************

* Deprecated dictionary ``bzrlib.option.SHORT_OPTIONS`` removed.
  Options are now required to provide a help string and it must
  comply with the style guide by being one or more sentences with an
  initial capital and final period. (Martin Pool)

* KnitIndex.get_parents now returns tuples. (Robert Collins)

* Ancient unused ``Repository.text_store`` attribute has been removed.
  (Robert Collins)

* The ``bzrlib.pack`` interface has changed to use tuples of bytestrings
  rather than just bytestrings, making it easier to represent multiple
  element names. As this interface was not used by any internal facilities
  since it was introduced in 0.18 no API compatibility is being preserved.
  The serialised form of these packs is identical with 0.18 when a single
  element tuple is in use. (Robert Collins)

Internals
*********

* merge now uses ``iter_changes`` to calculate changes, which makes room for
  future performance increases.  It is also more consistent with other
  operations that perform comparisons, and reduces reliance on
  Tree.inventory.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Refactoring of transport classes connected to a remote server.
  ConnectedTransport is a new class that serves as a basis for all
  transports needing to connect to a remote server.  transport.split_url
  have been deprecated, use the static method on the object instead. URL
  tests have been refactored too.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Better connection sharing for ConnectedTransport objects.
  transport.get_transport() now accepts a 'possible_transports' parameter.
  If a newly requested transport can share a connection with one of the
  list, it will.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Most functions now accept ``bzrlib.revision.NULL_REVISION`` to indicate
  the null revision, and consider using ``None`` for this purpose
  deprecated.  (Aaron Bentley)

* New ``index`` module with abstract index functionality. This will be
  used during the planned changes in the repository layer. Currently the
  index layer provides a graph aware immutable index, a builder for the
  same index type to allow creating them, and finally a composer for
  such indices to allow the use of many indices in a single query. The
  index performance is not optimised, however the API is stable to allow
  development on top of the index. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.dirstate.cmp_by_dirs`` can be used to compare two paths by
  their directory sections. This is equivalent to comparing
  ``path.split('/')``, only without having to split the paths.
  This has a Pyrex implementation available.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* New transport decorator 'unlistable+' which disables the list_dir
  functionality for testing.

* Deprecated ``change_entry`` in transform.py. (Ian Clatworthy)

* RevisionTree.get_weave is now deprecated.  Tree.plan_merge is now used
  for performing annotate-merge.  (Aaron Bentley)

* New EmailMessage class to create email messages. (Adeodato Simó)

* Unused functions on the private interface KnitIndex have been removed.
  (Robert Collins)

* New ``knit.KnitGraphIndex`` which provides a ``KnitIndex`` layered on top
  of a ``index.GraphIndex``. (Robert Collins)

* New ``knit.KnitVersionedFile.iter_parents`` method that allows querying
  the parents of many knit nodes at once, reducing round trips to the
  underlying index. (Robert Collins)

* Graph now has an is_ancestor method, various bits use it.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* The ``-Dhpss`` flag now includes timing information. As well as
  logging when a new connection is opened. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzrlib.pack.ContainerWriter`` now returns an offset, length tuple to
  callers when inserting data, allowing generation of readv style access
  during pack creation, without needing a separate pass across the output
  pack to gather such details. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.pack.make_readv_reader`` allows readv based access to pack
  files that are stored on a transport. (Robert Collins)

* New ``Repository.has_same_location`` method that reports if two
  repository objects refer to the same repository (although with some risk
  of false negatives).  (Andrew Bennetts)

* InterTree.compare now passes require_versioned on correctly.
  (Marius Kruger)

* New methods on Repository - ``start_write_group``,
  ``commit_write_group``, ``abort_write_group`` and ``is_in_write_group`` -
  which provide a clean hook point for transactional Repositories - ones
  where all the data for a fetch or commit needs to be made atomically
  available in one step. This allows the write lock to remain while making
  a series of data insertions.  (e.g. data conversion). (Robert Collins)

* In ``bzrlib.knit`` the internal interface has been altered to use
  3-tuples (index, pos, length) rather than two-tuples (pos, length) to
  describe where data in a knit is, allowing knits to be split into
  many files. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.knit._KnitData`` split into cache management and physical access
  with two access classes - ``_PackAccess`` and ``_KnitAccess`` defined.
  The former provides access into a .pack file, and the latter provides the
  current production repository form of .knit files. (Robert Collins)

Testing
*******

* Remove selftest ``--clean-output``, ``--numbered-dirs`` and
  ``--keep-output`` options, which are obsolete now that tests
  are done within directories in $TMPDIR.  (Martin Pool)

* The SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable is now reset to avoid
  interaction with any running ssh agents.  (Jelmer Vernooij, #125955)

* run_bzr_subprocess handles parameters the same way as run_bzr:
  either a string or a list of strings should be passed as the first
  parameter.  Varargs-style parameters are deprecated. (Aaron Bentley)


bzr 0.18

:Released:  2007-07-17

Bugfixes
********

* Fix 'bzr add' crash under Win32 (Kuno Meyer)


bzr 0.18rc1
###########

:Released:  2007-07-10

Bugfixes
********

* Do not suppress pipe errors, etc. in non-display commands
  (Alexander Belchenko, #87178)

* Display a useful error message when the user requests to annotate
  a file that is not present in the specified revision.
  (James Westby, #122656)

* Commands that use status flags now have a reference to 'help
  status-flags'.  (Daniel Watkins, #113436)

* Work around python-2.4.1 inhability to correctly parse the
  authentication header.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #121889)

* Use exact encoding for merge directives. (Adeodato Simó, #120591)

* Fix tempfile permissions error in smart server tar bundling under
  Windows. (Martin _, #119330)

* Fix detection of directory entries in the inventory. (James Westby)

* Fix handling of http code 400: Bad Request When issuing too many ranges.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #115209)

* Issue a CONNECT request when connecting to an https server
  via a proxy to enable SSL tunneling.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #120678)

* Fix ``bzr log -r`` to support selecting merge revisions, both
  individually and as part of revision ranges.
  (Kent Gibson, #4663)

* Don't leave cruft behind when failing to acquire a lockdir.
  (Martin Pool, #109169)

* Don't use the '-f' strace option during tests.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #102019).

* Warn when setting ``push_location`` to a value that will be masked by
  locations.conf.  (Aaron Bentley, #122286)

* Fix commit ordering in corner case (Aaron Bentley, #94975)

*  Make annotate behave in a non-ASCII world (Adeodato Simó).

Improvements
************

* The --lsprof-file option now dumps a text rendering of the profiling
  information if the filename ends in ".txt". It will also convert the
  profiling information to a format suitable for KCacheGrind if the
  output filename ends in ".callgrind". Fixes to the lsprofcalltree
  conversion process by Jean Paul Calderone and Itamar were also merged.
  See http://ddaa.net/blog/python/lsprof-calltree. (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``info`` now defaults to non-verbose mode, displaying only paths and
  abbreviated format info.  ``info -v`` displays all the information
  formerly displayed by ``info``.  (Aaron Bentley, Adeodato Simó)

* ``bzr missing`` now has better option names ``--this`` and ``--other``.
  (Elliot Murphy)

* The internal ``weave-list`` command has become ``versionedfile-list``,
  and now lists knits as well as weaves.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Automatic merge base selection uses a faster algorithm that chooses
  better bases in criss-cross merge situations (Aaron Bentley)

* Progress reporting in ``commit`` has been improved. The various logical
  stages are now reported on as follows, namely:

  * Collecting changes [Entry x/y] - Stage n/m
  * Saving data locally - Stage n/m
  * Uploading data to master branch - Stage n/m
  * Updating the working tree - Stage n/m
  * Running post commit hooks - Stage n/m

  If there is no master branch, the 3rd stage is omitted and the total
  number of stages is adjusted accordingly.

  Each hook that is run after commit is listed with a name (as hooks
  can be slow it is useful feedback).
  (Ian Clatworthy, Robert Collins)

* Various operations that are now faster due to avoiding unnecessary
  topological sorts. (Aaron Bentley)

* Make merge directives robust against broken bundles. (Aaron Bentley)

* The lsprof filename note is emitted via trace.note(), not standard
  output.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzrlib`` now exports explicit API compatibility information to assist
  library users and plugins. See the ``bzrlib.api`` module for details.
  (Robert Collins)

* Remove unnecessary lock probes when acquiring a lockdir.
  (Martin Pool)

* ``bzr --version`` now shows the location of the bzr log file, which
  is especially useful on Windows.  (Martin Pool)

* -D now supports hooks to get debug tracing of hooks (though its currently
  minimal in nature). (Robert Collins)

* Long log format reports deltas on merge revisions.
  (John Arbash Meinel, Kent Gibson)

* Make initial push over ftp more resilient. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Print a summary of changes for update just like pull does.
  (Daniel Watkins, #113990)

* Add a -Dhpss option to trace smart protocol requests and responses.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

Library API Breaks
******************

* Testing cleanups -
  ``bzrlib.repository.RepositoryTestProviderAdapter`` has been moved
  to ``bzrlib.tests.repository_implementations``;
  ``bzrlib.repository.InterRepositoryTestProviderAdapter`` has been moved
  to ``bzrlib.tests.interrepository_implementations``;
  ``bzrlib.transport.TransportTestProviderAdapter`` has moved to
  ``bzrlib.tests.test_transport_implementations``.
  ``bzrlib.branch.BranchTestProviderAdapter`` has moved to
  ``bzrlib.tests.branch_implementations``.
  ``bzrlib.bzrdir.BzrDirTestProviderAdapter`` has moved to
  ``bzrlib.tests.bzrdir_implementations``.
  ``bzrlib.versionedfile.InterVersionedFileTestProviderAdapter`` has moved
  to ``bzrlib.tests.interversionedfile_implementations``.
  ``bzrlib.store.revision.RevisionStoreTestProviderAdapter`` has moved to
  ``bzrlib.tests.revisionstore_implementations``.
  ``bzrlib.workingtree.WorkingTreeTestProviderAdapter`` has moved to
  ``bzrlib.tests.workingtree_implementations``.
  These changes are an API break in the testing infrastructure only.
  (Robert Collins)

* Relocate TestCaseWithRepository to be more central. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.add.smart_add_tree`` will no longer perform glob expansion on
  win32. Callers of the function should do this and use the new
  ``MutableTree.smart_add`` method instead. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.add.glob_expand_for_win32`` is now
  ``bzrlib.win32utils.glob_expand``.  (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.add.FastPath`` is now private and moved to
  ``bzrlib.mutabletree._FastPath``. (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

* ``LockDir.wait`` removed.  (Martin Pool)

* The ``SmartServer`` hooks API has changed for the ``server_started`` and
  ``server_stopped`` hooks. The first parameter is now an iterable of
  backing URLs rather than a single URL. This is to reflect that many
  URLs may map to the external URL of the server. E.g. the server interally
  may have a chrooted URL but also the local file:// URL will be at the
  same location. (Robert Collins)

Internals
*********

* New SMTPConnection class to unify email handling.  (Adeodato Simó)

* Fix documentation of BzrError. (Adeodato Simó)

* Make BzrBadParameter an internal error. (Adeodato Simó)

* Remove use of 'assert False' to raise an exception unconditionally.
  (Martin Pool)

* Give a cleaner error when failing to decode knit index entry.
  (Martin Pool)

* TreeConfig would mistakenly search the top level when asked for options
  from a section. It now respects the section argument and only
  searches the specified section. (James Westby)

* Improve ``make api-docs`` output. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Use os.lstat rather than os.stat for osutils.make_readonly and
  osutils.make_writeable. This makes the difftools plugin more
  robust when dangling symlinks are found. (Elliot Murphy)

* New ``-Dlock`` option to log (to ~/.bzr.log) information on when
  lockdirs are taken or released.  (Martin Pool)

* ``bzrlib`` Hooks are now nameable using ``Hooks.name_hook``. This
  allows a nicer UI when hooks are running as the current hook can
  be displayed. (Robert Collins)

* ``Transport.get`` has had its interface made more clear for ease of use.
  Retrieval of a directory must now fail with either 'PathError' at open
  time, or raise 'ReadError' on a read. (Robert Collins)

* New method ``_maybe_expand_globs`` on the ``Command`` class for
  dealing with unexpanded glob lists - e.g. on the win32 platform. This
  was moved from ``bzrlib.add._prepare_file_list``. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.add.smart_add`` and ``bzrlib.add.smart_add_tree`` are now
  deprecated in favour of ``MutableTree.smart_add``. (Robert Collins,
  Martin Pool)

* New method ``external_url`` on Transport for obtaining the url to
  hand to external processes. (Robert Collins)

* Teach windows installers to build pyrex/C extensions.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

Testing
*******

* Removed the ``--keep-output`` option from selftest and clean up test
  directories as they're used.  This reduces the IO load from
  running the test suite and cuts the time by about half.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool)

* Add scenarios as a public attribute on the TestAdapter classes to allow
  modification of the generated scenarios before adaption and easier
  testing. (Robert Collins)

* New testing support class ``TestScenarioApplier`` which multiplies
  out a single teste by a list of supplied scenarios. (RobertCollins)

* Setting ``repository_to_test_repository`` on a repository_implementations
  test will cause it to be called during repository creation, allowing the
  testing of repository classes which are not based around the Format
  concept. For example a repository adapter can be tested in this manner,
  by altering the repository scenarios to include a scenario that sets this
  attribute during the test parameterisation in
  ``bzrlib.tests.repository.repository_implementations``. (Robert Collins)

* Clean up many of the APIs for blackbox testing of Bazaar.  The standard
  interface is now self.run_bzr.  The command to run can be passed as
  either a list of parameters, a string containing the command line, or
  (deprecated) varargs parameters.  (Martin Pool)

* The base TestCase now isolates tests from -D parameters by clearing
  ``debug.debug_flags`` and restores it afterwards. (Robert Collins)

* Add a relpath parameter to get_transport methods in test framework to
  avoid useless cloning.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #110448)

bzr 0.17rc1
###########

:Released:  2007-06-12

Notes When Upgrading
********************

* The kind() and is_executable() APIs on the WorkingTree interface no
  longer implicitly (read) locks and unlocks the tree. This *might*
  impact some plug-ins and tools using this part of the API. If you find
  an issue that may be caused by this change, please let us know,
  particularly the plug-in/tool maintainer. If encountered, the API
  fix is to surround kind() and is_executable() calls with lock_read()
  and unlock() like so::

    work_tree.lock_read()
    try:
        kind = work_tree.kind(...)
    finally:
        work_tree.unlock()

Internals
*********
* Rework of LogFormatter API to provide beginning/end of log hooks and to
  encapsulate the details of the revision to be logged in a LogRevision
  object.
  In long log formats, merge revision ids are only shown when --show-ids
  is specified, and are labelled "revision-id:", as per mainline
  revisions, instead of "merged:". (Kent Gibson)

* New ``BranchBuilder`` API which allows the construction of particular
  histories quickly. Useful for testing and potentially other applications
  too. (Robert Collins)

Improvements
************

* There are two new help topics, working-trees and repositories that
  attempt to explain these concepts. (James Westby, John Arbash Meinel,
  Aaron Bentley)

* Added ``bzr log --limit`` to report a limited number of revisions.
  (Kent Gibson, #3659)

* Revert does not try to preserve file contents that were originally
  produced by reverting to a historical revision.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr log --short`` now includes ``[merge]`` for revisions which
  have more than one parent. This is a small improvement to help
  understanding what changes have occurred
  (John Arbash Meinel, #83887)

* TreeTransform avoids many renames when contructing large trees,
  improving speed.  3.25x speedups have been observed for construction of
  kernel-sized-trees, and checkouts are 1.28x faster.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Commit on large trees is now faster. In my environment, a commit of
  a small change to the Mozilla tree (55k files) has dropped from
  66 seconds to 32 seconds. For a small tree of 600 files, commit of a
  small change is 33% faster. (Ian Clatworthy)

* New --create-prefix option to bzr init, like for push.  (Daniel Watkins,
  #56322)

Bugfixes
********

* ``bzr push`` should only connect to the remote location one time.
  We have been connecting 3 times because we forget to pass around
  the Transport object. This adds ``BzrDir.clone_on_transport()``, so
  that we can pass in the Transport that we already have.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #75721)

* ``DirState.set_state_from_inventory()`` needs to properly order
  based on split paths, not just string paths.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #115947)

* Let TestUIFactoy encode the password prompt with its own stdout.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #110204)

* pycurl should take use the range header that takes the range hint
  into account.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #112719)

* WorkingTree4.get_file_sha1 no longer raises an exception when invoked
  on a missing file.  (Aaron Bentley, #118186)

* WorkingTree.remove works correctly with tree references, and when pwd is
  not the tree root. (Aaron Bentley)

* Merge no longer fails when a file is renamed in one tree and deleted
  in the other. (Aaron Bentley, #110279)

* ``revision-info`` now accepts dotted revnos, doesn't require a tree,
  and defaults to the last revision (Matthew Fuller, #90048)

* Tests no longer fail when BZR_REMOTE_PATH is set in the environment.
  (Daniel Watkins, #111958)

* ``bzr branch -r revid:foo`` can be used to branch any revision in
  your repository. (Previously Branch6 only supported revisions in your
  mainline). (John Arbash Meinel, #115343)

* Handle when you have 2 directories with similar names, but one has a
  hyphen. (``'abc'`` versus ``'abc-2'``). The WT4._iter_changes
  iterator was using direct comparison and ``'abc/a'`` sorts after
  ``'abc-2'``, but ``('abc', 'a')`` sorts before ``('abc-2',)``.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #111227)

* Handle when someone renames a file on disk without telling bzr.
  Previously we would report the first file as missing, but not show
  the new unknown file. (John Arbash Meinel, #111288)

* Avoid error when running hooks after pulling into or pushing from
  a branch bound to a smartserver branch.  (Martin Pool, #111968)

Improvements
************

* Move developer documentation to doc/developers/. This reduces clutter in
  the root of the source tree and allows HACKING to be split into multiple
  files. (Robert Collins, Alexander Belchenko)

* Clean up the ``WorkingTree4._iter_changes()`` internal loops as well as
  ``DirState.update_entry()``. This optimizes the core logic for ``bzr
  diff`` and ``bzr status`` significantly improving the speed of
  both. (John Arbash Meinel)

Bugfixes
********

* Handle the case when you delete a file, and then rename another file
  on top of it. Also handle the case of ``bzr rm --keep foo``. ``bzr
  status`` should show the removed file and an unknown file in its
  place. (John Arbash Meinel, #109993)

* Bundles properly read and write revision properties that have an
  empty value. And when the value is not ASCII.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #109613)

* Fix the bzr commit message to be in text mode.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #110901)

* Also handle when you rename a file and create a file where it used
  to be. (John Arbash Meinel, #110256)

* ``WorkingTree4._iter_changes`` should not descend into unversioned
  directories. (John Arbash Meinel, #110399)

bzr 0.16rc1

:Released:  2007-04-26

Notes When Upgrading
********************

* ``bzr remove`` and ``bzr rm`` will now remove the working file, if
  it could be recovered again.
  This has been done for consistency with svn and the unix rm command.
  The old ``remove`` behaviour has been retained in the new option
  ``bzr remove --keep``, which will just stop versioning the file,
  but not delete it.
  ``bzr remove --force`` have been added which will always delete the
  files.
  ``bzr remove`` is also more verbose.
  (Marius Kruger, #82602)

Improvements
************

* Merge directives can now be supplied as input to `merge` and `pull`,
  like bundles can.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Sending the SIGQUIT signal to bzr, which can be done on Unix by
  pressing Control-Backslash, drops bzr into a debugger.  Type ``'c'``
  to continue.  This can be disabled by setting the environment variable
  ``BZR_SIGQUIT_PDB=0``.  (Martin Pool)

* selftest now supports --list-only to list tests instead of running
  them. (Ian Clatworthy)

* selftest now supports --exclude PATTERN (or -x PATTERN) to exclude
  tests with names that match that regular expression.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #102679)

* selftest now supports --randomize SEED to run tests in a random order.
  SEED is typically the value 'now' meaning 'use the current time'.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #102686)

* New option ``--fixes`` to commit, which stores bug fixing annotations as
  revision properties. Built-in support for Launchpad, Debian, Trac and
  Bugzilla bug trackers. (Jonathan Lange, James Henstridge, Robert Collins)

* New API, ``bzrlib.bugtracker.tracker_registry``, for adding support for
  other bug trackers to ``fixes``. (Jonathan Lange, James Henstridge,
  Robert Collins)

* ``selftest`` has new short options ``-f`` and ``-1``.  (Martin
  Pool)

* ``bzrlib.tsort.MergeSorter`` optimizations. Change the inner loop
  into using local variables instead of going through ``self._var``.
  Improves the time to ``merge_sort`` a 10k revision graph by
  approximately 40% (~700->400ms).  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``make docs`` now creates a man page at ``man1/bzr.1`` fixing bug 107388.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``bzr help`` now provides cross references to other help topics using
  the _see_also facility on command classes. Likewise the bzr_man
  documentation, and the bzr.1 man page also include this information.
  (Robert Collins)

* Tags are now included in logs, that use the long log formatter.
  (Erik Bågfors, Alexander Belchenko)

* ``bzr help`` provides a clearer message when a help topic cannot be
  found. (Robert Collins, #107656)

* ``bzr help`` now accepts optional prefixes for command help. The help
  for all commands can now be found at ``bzr help commands/COMMANDNAME``
  as well as ``bzr help COMMANDNAME`` (which only works for commands
  where the name is not the same as a more general help topic).
  (Robert Collins)

* ``bzr help PLUGINNAME`` will now return the module docstring from the
  plugin PLUGINNAME. (Robert Collins, #50408)

* New help topic ``urlspec`` which lists the availables transports.
  (Goffredo Baroncelli)

* doc/server.txt updated to document the default bzr:// port
  and also update the blurb about the hpss' current status.
  (Robert Collins, #107125).

* ``bzr serve`` now listens on interface 0.0.0.0 by default, making it
  serve out to the local LAN (and anyone in the world that can reach the
  machine running ``bzr serve``. (Robert Collins, #98918)

* A new smart server protocol version has been added.  It prefixes requests
  and responses with an explicit version identifier so that future protocol
  revisions can be dealt with gracefully.  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* The bzr protocol version 2 indicates success or failure in every response
  without depending on particular commands encoding that consistently,
  allowing future client refactorings to be much more robust about error
  handling. (Robert Collins, Martin Pool, Andrew Bennetts)

* The smart protocol over HTTP client has been changed to always post to the
  same ``.bzr/smart`` URL under the original location when it can.  This allows
  HTTP servers to only have to pass URLs ending in .bzr/smart to the smart
  server handler, and not arbitrary ``.bzr/*/smart`` URLs.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* digest authentication is now supported for proxies and HTTP by the urllib
  based http implementation. Tested against Apache 2.0.55 and Squid
  2.6.5. Basic and digest authentication are handled coherently for HTTP
  and proxy: if the user is provided in the url (bzr command line for HTTP,
  proxy environment variables for proxies), the password is prompted for
  (only once). If the password is provided, it is taken into account. Once
  the first authentication is successful, all further authentication
  roundtrips are avoided by preventively setting the right authentication
  header(s).
  (Vincent Ladeuil).

Internals
*********

* bzrlib API compatability with 0.8 has been dropped, cleaning up some
  code paths. (Robert Collins)

* Change the format of chroot urls so that they can be safely manipulated
  by generic url utilities without causing the resulting urls to have
  escaped the chroot. A side effect of this is that creating a chroot
  requires an explicit action using a ChrootServer.
  (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* Deprecate ``Branch.get_root_id()`` because branches don't have root ids,
  rather than fixing bug #96847.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``WorkingTree.apply_inventory_delta`` provides a better alternative to
  ``WorkingTree._write_inventory``.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Convenience method ``TestCase.expectFailure`` ensures that known failures
  do not silently pass.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``Transport.local_abspath`` now raises ``NotLocalUrl`` rather than
  ``TransportNotPossible``. (Martin Pool, Ian Clatworthy)

* New SmartServer hooks facility. There are two initial hooks documented
  in ``bzrlib.transport.smart.SmartServerHooks``. The two initial hooks allow
  plugins to execute code upon server startup and shutdown.
  (Robert Collins).

* SmartServer in standalone mode will now close its listening socket
  when it stops, rather than waiting for garbage collection. This primarily
  fixes test suite hangs when a test tries to connect to a shutdown server.
  It may also help improve behaviour when dealing with a server running
  on a specific port (rather than dynamically assigned ports).
  (Robert Collins)

* Move most SmartServer code into a new package, bzrlib/smart.
  bzrlib/transport/remote.py contains just the Transport classes that used
  to be in bzrlib/transport/smart.py.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* urllib http implementation avoid roundtrips associated with
  401 (and 407) errors once the authentication succeeds.
  (Vincent Ladeuil).

* urlib http now supports querying the user for a proxy password if
  needed. Realm is shown in the prompt for both HTTP and proxy
  authentication when the user is required to type a password.
  (Vincent Ladeuil).

* Renamed SmartTransport (and subclasses like SmartTCPTransport) to
  RemoteTransport (and subclasses to RemoteTCPTransport, etc).  This is more
  consistent with its new home in ``bzrlib/transport/remote.py``, and because
  it's not really a "smart" transport, just one that does file operations
  via remote procedure calls.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* The ``lock_write`` method of ``LockableFiles``, ``Repository`` and
  ``Branch`` now accept a ``token`` keyword argument, so that separate
  instances of those objects can share a lock if it has the right token.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* New method ``get_branch_reference`` on ``BzrDir`` allows the detection of
  branch references - which the smart server component needs.

* The Repository API ``make_working_trees`` is now permitted to return
  False when ``set_make_working_trees`` is not implemented - previously
  an unimplemented ``set_make_working_trees`` implied the result True
  from ``make_working_trees``. This has been changed to accomodate the
  smart server, where it does not make sense (at this point) to ever
  make working trees by default. (Robert Collins)

* Command objects can now declare related help topics by having _see_also
  set to a list of related topic. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.help`` now delegates to the Command class for Command specific
  help. (Robert Collins)

* New class ``TransportListRegistry``, derived from the Registry class, which
  simplifies tracking the available Transports. (Goffredo Baroncelli)

* New function ``Branch.get_revision_id_to_revno_map`` which will
  return a dictionary mapping revision ids to dotted revnos. Since
  dotted revnos are defined in the context of the branch tip, it makes
  sense to generate them from a ``Branch`` object.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Fix the 'Unprintable error' message display to use the repr of the
  exception that prevented printing the error because the str value
  for it is often not useful in debugging (e.g. KeyError('foo') has a
  str() of 'foo' but a repr of 'KeyError('foo')' which is much more
  useful. (Robert Collins)

* ``urlutils.normalize_url`` now unescapes unreserved characters, such as "~".
  (Andrew Bennetts)

Bugfixes
********

* Don't fail bundle selftest if email has 'two' embedded.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #98510)

* Remove ``--verbose`` from ``bzr bundle``. It didn't work anyway.
  (Robert Widhopf-Fenk, #98591)

* Remove ``--basis`` from the checkout/branch commands - it didn't work
  properly and is no longer beneficial.
  (Robert Collins, #53675, #43486)

* Don't produce encoding error when adding duplicate files.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Fix ``bzr log <file>`` so it only logs the revisions that changed
  the file, and does it faster.
  (Kent Gibson, John Arbash Meinel, #51980, #69477)

* Fix ``InterDirstateTre._iter_changes`` to handle when we come across
  an empty versioned directory, which now has files in it.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #104257)

* Teach ``common_ancestor`` to shortcut when the tip of one branch is
  inside the ancestry of the other. Saves a lot of graph processing
  (with an ancestry of 16k revisions, ``bzr merge ../already-merged``
  changes from 2m10s to 13s).  (John Arbash Meinel, #103757)

* Fix ``show_diff_trees`` to handle the case when a file is modified,
  and the containing directory is renamed. (The file path is different
  in this versus base, but it isn't marked as a rename).
  (John Arbash Meinel, #103870)

* FTP now works even when the FTP server does not support atomic rename.
  (Aaron Bentley, #89436)

* Correct handling in bundles and merge directives of timezones with
  that are not an integer number of hours offset from UTC.  Always
  represent the epoch time in UTC to avoid problems with formatting
  earlier times on win32.  (Martin Pool, Alexander Belchenko, John
  Arbash Meinel)

* Typo in the help for ``register-branch`` fixed. (Robert Collins, #96770)

* "dirstate" and "dirstate-tags" formats now produce branches compatible
  with old versions of bzr. (Aaron Bentley, #107168))

* Handle moving a directory when children have been added, removed,
  and renamed. (John Arbash Meinel, #105479)

* Don't preventively use basic authentication for proxy before receiving a
  407 error. Otherwise people willing to use other authentication schemes
  may expose their password in the clear (or nearly). This add one
  roundtrip in case basic authentication should be used, but plug the
  security hole.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Handle http and proxy digest authentication.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #94034).

Testing
*******

* Added ``bzrlib.strace.strace`` which will strace a single callable and
  return a StraceResult object which contains just the syscalls involved
  in running it. (Robert Collins)

* New test method ``reduceLockdirTimeout`` to drop the default (ui-centric)
  default time down to one suitable for tests. (Andrew Bennetts)

* Add new ``vfs_transport_factory`` attribute on tests which provides the
  common vfs backing for both the readonly and readwrite transports.
  This allows the RemoteObject tests to back onto local disk or memory,
  and use the existing ``transport_server`` attribute all tests know about
  to be the smart server transport. This in turn allows tests to
  differentiate between 'transport to access the branch', and
  'transport which is a VFS' - which matters in Remote* tests.
  (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* The ``make_branch_and_tree`` method for tests will now create a
  lightweight checkout for the tree if the ``vfs_transport_factory`` is not
  a LocalURLServer. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* Branch implementation tests have been audited to ensure that all urls
  passed to Branch APIs use proper urls, except when local-disk paths
  are intended. This is so that tests correctly access the test transport
  which is often not equivalent to local disk in Remote* tests. As part
  of this many tests were adjusted to remove dependencies on local disk
  access.
  (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* Mark bzrlib.tests and bzrlib.tests.TestUtil as providing assertFOO helper
  functions by adding a ``__unittest`` global attribute. (Robert Collins,
  Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool, Jonathan Lange)

* Refactored proxy and authentication handling to simplify the
  implementation of new auth schemes for both http and proxy.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

:Released: 2007-04-01

Bugfixes
********

* Handle incompatible repositories as a user issue when fetching.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Don't give a recommendation to upgrade when branching or
  checking out a branch that contains an old-format working tree.
  (Martin Pool)

bzr 0.15rc3
###########

:Released:  2007-03-26

Changes
*******

* A warning is now displayed when opening working trees in older
  formats, to encourage people to upgrade to WorkingTreeFormat4.
  (Martin Pool)

Improvements
************

* HTTP redirections are now taken into account when a branch (or a
  bundle) is accessed for the first time. A message is issued at each
  redirection to inform the user. In the past, http redirections were
  silently followed for each request which significantly degraded the
  performances. The http redirections are not followed anymore by
  default, instead a RedirectRequested exception is raised. For bzrlib
  users needing to follow http redirections anyway,
  ``bzrlib.transport.do_catching_redirections`` provide an easy transition
  path.  (vila)

Internals
*********

* Added ``ReadLock.temporary_write_lock()`` to allow upgrading an OS read
  lock to an OS write lock. Linux can do this without unlocking, Win32
  needs to unlock in between. (John Arbash Meinel)

* New parameter ``recommend_upgrade`` to ``BzrDir.open_workingtree``
  to silence (when false) warnings about opening old formats.
  (Martin Pool)

* Fix minor performance regression with bzr-0.15 on pre-dirstate
  trees. (We were reading the working inventory too many times).
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Remove ``Branch.get_transaction()`` in favour of a simple cache of
  ``revision_history``.  Branch subclasses should override
  ``_gen_revision_history`` rather than ``revision_history`` to make use of
  this cache, and call ``_clear_revision_history_cache`` and
  ``_cache_revision_history`` at appropriate times. (Andrew Bennetts)

Bugfixes
********

* Take ``smtp_server`` from user config into account.
  (vila, #92195)

* Restore Unicode filename handling for versioned and unversioned files.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #92608)

* Don't fail during ``bzr commit`` if a file is marked removed, and
  the containing directory is auto-removed.  (John Arbash Meinel, #93681)

* ``bzr status FILENAME`` failed on Windows because of an uncommon
  errno. (``ERROR_DIRECTORY == 267 != ENOTDIR``).
  (Wouter van Heyst, John Arbash Meinel, #90819)

* ``bzr checkout source`` should create a local branch in the same
  format as source. (John Arbash Meinel, #93854)

* ``bzr commit`` with a kind change was failing to update the
  last-changed-revision for directories.  The
  InventoryDirectory._unchanged only looked at the ``parent_id`` and name,
  ignoring the fact that the kind could have changed, too.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #90111)

* ``bzr mv dir/subdir other`` was incorrectly updating files inside
  the directory. So that there was a chance it would break commit,
  etc. (John Arbash Meinel, #94037)

* Correctly handles mutiple permanent http redirections.
  (vila, #88780)

bzr 0.15rc2
###########

:Released:  2007-03-14

Notes When Upgrading
********************

* Release 0.15rc2 of bzr changes the ``bzr init-repo`` command to
  default to ``--trees`` instead of ``--no-trees``.
  Existing shared repositories are not affected.

Improvements
************

* New ``merge-directive`` command to generate machine- and human-readable
  merge requests.  (Aaron Bentley)

* New ``submit:`` revision specifier makes it easy to diff against the
  common ancestor with the submit location (Aaron Bentley)

* Added support for Putty's SSH implementation. (Dmitry Vasiliev)

* Added ``bzr status --versioned`` to report only versioned files,
  not unknowns. (Kent Gibson)

* Merge now autodetects the correct line-ending style for its conflict
  markers.  (Aaron Bentley)

Internals
*********

* Refactored SSH vendor registration into SSHVendorManager class.
  (Dmitry Vasiliev)

Bugfixes
********

* New ``--numbered-dirs`` option to ``bzr selftest`` to use
  numbered dirs for TestCaseInTempDir. This is default behavior
  on Windows. Anyone can force named dirs on Windows
  with ``--no-numbered-dirs``. (Alexander Belchenko)

* Fix ``RevisionSpec_revid`` to handle the Unicode strings passed in
  from the command line. (Marien Zwart, #90501)

* Fix ``TreeTransform._iter_changes`` when both the source and
  destination are missing. (Aaron Bentley, #88842)

* Fix commit of merges with symlinks in dirstate trees.
  (Marien Zwart)

* Switch the ``bzr init-repo`` default from --no-trees to --trees.
  (Wouter van Heyst, #53483)


bzr 0.15rc1
###########

:Released:  2007-03-07

Surprises
*********

* The default disk format has changed. Please run 'bzr upgrade' in your
  working trees to upgrade. This new default is compatible for network
  operations, but not for local operations. That is, if you have two
  versions of bzr installed locally, after upgrading you can only use the
  bzr 0.15 version. This new default does not enable tags or nested-trees
  as they are incompatible with bzr versions before 0.15 over the network.

* For users of bzrlib: Two major changes have been made to the working tree
  api in bzrlib. The first is that many methods and attributes, including
  the inventory attribute, are no longer valid for use until one of
  ``lock_read``/``lock_write``/``lock_tree_write`` has been called,
  and become invalid again after unlock is called. This has been done
  to improve performance and correctness as part of the dirstate
  development.
  (Robert Collins, John A Meinel, Martin Pool, and others).

* For users of bzrlib: The attribute 'tree.inventory' should be considered
  readonly. Previously it was possible to directly alter this attribute, or
  its contents, and have the tree notice this. This has been made
  unsupported - it may work in some tree formats, but in the newer dirstate
  format such actions will have no effect and will be ignored, or even
  cause assertions. All operations possible can still be carried out by a
  combination of the tree API, and the bzrlib.transform API. (Robert
  Collins, John A Meinel, Martin Pool, and others).

Improvements
************

* Support for OS Windows 98. Also .bzr.log on any windows system
  saved in My Documents folder. (Alexander Belchenko)

* ``bzr mv`` enhanced to support already moved files.
  In the past the mv command would have failed if the source file doesn't
  exist. In this situation ``bzr mv`` would now detect that the file has
  already moved and update the repository accordingly, if the target file
  does exist.
  A new option ``--after`` has been added so that if two files already
  exist, you could notify Bazaar that you have moved a (versioned) file
  and replaced it with another. Thus in this case ``bzr move --after``
  will only update the Bazaar identifier.
  (Steffen Eichenberg, Marius Kruger)

* ``ls`` now works on treeless branches and remote branches.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr help global-options`` describes the global options.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr pull --overwrite`` will now correctly overwrite checkouts.
  (Robert Collins)

* Files are now allowed to change kind (e.g. from file to symlink).
  Supported by ``commit``, ``revert`` and ``status``
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``inventory`` and ``unknowns`` hidden in favour of ``ls``
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr help checkouts`` descibes what checkouts are and some possible
  uses of them. (James Westby, Aaron Bentley)

* A new ``-d`` option to push, pull and merge overrides the default
  directory.  (Martin Pool)

* Branch format 6: smaller, and potentially faster than format 5.  Supports
  ``append_history_only`` mode, where the log view and revnos do not change,
  except by being added to.  Stores policy settings in
  ".bzr/branch/branch.conf".

* ``append_only`` branches:  Format 6 branches may be configured so that log
  view and revnos are always consistent.  Either create the branch using
  "bzr init --append-revisions-only" or edit the config file as descriped
  in docs/configuration.txt.

* rebind: Format 6 branches retain the last-used bind location, so if you
  "bzr unbind", you can "bzr bind" to bind to the previously-selected
  bind location.

* Builtin tags support, created and deleted by the ``tag`` command and
  stored in the branch.  Tags can be accessed with the revisionspec
  ``-rtag:``, and listed with ``bzr tags``.  Tags are not versioned
  at present. Tags require a network incompatible upgrade. To perform this
  upgrade, run ``bzr upgrade --dirstate-tags`` in your branch and
  repositories. (Martin Pool)

* The ``bzr://`` transport now has a well-known port number, 4155,
  which it will use by default.  (Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool)

* Bazaar now looks for user-installed plugins before looking for site-wide
  plugins. (Jonathan Lange)

* ``bzr resolve`` now detects and marks resolved text conflicts.
  (Aaron Bentley)

Internals
*********

* Internally revision ids and file ids are now passed around as utf-8
  bytestrings, rather than treating them as Unicode strings. This has
  performance benefits for Knits, since we no longer need to decode the
  revision id for each line of content, nor for each entry in the index.
  This will also help with the future dirstate format.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Reserved ids (any revision-id ending in a colon) are rejected by
  versionedfiles, repositories, branches, and working trees
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Minor performance improvement by not creating a ProgressBar for
  every KnitIndex we create. (about 90ms for a bzr.dev tree)
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* New easier to use Branch hooks facility. There are five initial hooks,
  all documented in bzrlib.branch.BranchHooks.__init__ - ``'set_rh'``,
  ``'post_push'``, ``'post_pull'``, ``'post_commit'``,
  ``'post_uncommit'``. These hooks fire after the matching operation
  on a branch has taken place, and were originally added for the
  branchrss plugin. (Robert Collins)

* New method ``Branch.push()`` which should be used when pushing from a
  branch as it makes performance and policy decisions to match the UI
  level command ``push``. (Robert Collins).

* Add a new method ``Tree.revision_tree`` which allows access to cached
  trees for arbitrary revisions. This allows the in development dirstate
  tree format to provide access to the callers to cached copies of
  inventory data which are cheaper to access than inventories from the
  repository.
  (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

* New ``Branch.last_revision_info`` method, this is being done to allow
  optimization of requests for both the number of revisions and the last
  revision of a branch with smartservers and potentially future branch
  formats. (Wouter van Heyst, Robert Collins)

* Allow ``'import bzrlib.plugins.NAME'`` to work when the plugin NAME has not
  yet been loaded by ``load_plugins()``. This allows plugins to depend on each
  other for code reuse without requiring users to perform file-renaming
  gymnastics. (Robert Collins)

* New Repository method ``'gather_stats'`` for statistic data collection.
  This is expected to grow to cover a number of related uses mainly
  related to bzr info. (Robert Collins)

* Log formatters are now managed with a registry.
  ``log.register_formatter`` continues to work, but callers accessing
  the FORMATTERS dictionary directly will not.

* Allow a start message to be passed to the ``edit_commit_message``
  function.  This will be placed in the message offered to the user
  for editing above the separator. It allows a template commit message
  to be used more easily. (James Westby)

* ``GPGStrategy.sign()`` will now raise ``BzrBadParameterUnicode`` if
  you pass a Unicode string rather than an 8-bit string. Callers need
  to be updated to encode first. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Branch.push, pull, merge now return Result objects with information
  about what happened, rather than a scattering of various methods.  These
  are also passed to the post hooks.  (Martin Pool)

* File formats and architecture is in place for managing a forest of trees
  in bzr, and splitting up existing trees into smaller subtrees, and
  finally joining trees to make a larger tree. This is the first iteration
  of this support, and the user-facing aspects still require substantial
  work.  If you wish to experiment with it, use ``bzr upgrade
  --dirstate-with-subtree`` in your working trees and repositories.
  You can use the hidden commands ``split`` and ``join`` and to create
  and manipulate nested trees, but please consider using the nested-trees
  branch, which contains substantial UI improvements, instead.
  http://code.aaronbentley.com/bzr/bzrrepo/nested-trees/
  (Aaron Bentley, Martin Pool, Robert Collins).

Bugfixes
********

* ``bzr annotate`` now uses dotted revnos from the viewpoint of the
  branch, rather than the last changed revision of the file.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #82158)

* Lock operations no longer hang if they encounter a permission problem.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr push`` can resume a push that was canceled before it finished.
  Also, it can push even if the target directory exists if you supply
  the ``--use-existing-dir`` flag.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #30576, #45504)

* Fix http proxy authentication when user and an optional
  password appears in the ``*_proxy`` vars. (Vincent Ladeuil,
  #83954).

* ``bzr log branch/file`` works for local treeless branches
  (Aaron Bentley, #84247)

* Fix problem with UNC paths on Windows 98. (Alexander Belchenko, #84728)

* Searching location of CA bundle for PyCurl in env variable
  (``CURL_CA_BUNDLE``), and on win32 along the PATH.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #82086)

* ``bzr init`` works with unicode argument LOCATION.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #85599)

* Raise ``DependencyNotPresent`` if pycurl do not support https.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #85305)

* Invalid proxy env variables should not cause a traceback.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #87765)

* Ignore patterns normalised to use '/' path separator.
  (Kent Gibson, #86451)

* bzr rocks. It sure does! Fix case. (Vincent Ladeuil, #78026)

* Fix bzrtools shelve command for removed lines beginning with "--"
  (Johan Dahlberg, #75577)

Testing
*******

* New ``--first`` option to ``bzr selftest`` to run specified tests
  before the rest of the suite.  (Martin Pool)


bzr 0.14
########

:Released:  2007-01-23

Improvements
************

* ``bzr help global-options`` describes the global options. (Aaron Bentley)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Skip documentation generation tests if the tools to do so are not
  available. Fixes running selftest for installled copies of bzr.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #80330)

* Fix the code that discovers whether bzr is being run from it's
  working tree to handle the case when it isn't but the directory
  it is in is below a repository. (James Westby, #77306)


bzr 0.14rc1
###########

:Released:  2007-01-16

Improvements
************

* New connection: ``bzr+http://`` which supports tunnelling the smart
  protocol over an HTTP connection. If writing is enabled on the bzr
  server, then you can write over the http connection.
  (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel)

* Aliases now support quotation marks, so they can contain whitespace
  (Marius Kruger)

* PyCurlTransport now use a single curl object. By specifying explicitly
  the 'Range' header, we avoid the need to use two different curl objects
  (and two connections to the same server). (Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``bzr commit`` does not prompt for a message until it is very likely to
  succeed.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr conflicts`` now takes --text to list pathnames of text conflicts
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Fix ``iter_lines_added_or_present_in_versions`` to use a set instead
  of a list while checking if a revision id was requested. Takes 10s
  off of the ``fileids_affected_by_revision_ids`` time, which is 10s
  of the ``bzr branch`` time. Also improve ``fileids_...`` time by
  filtering lines with a regex rather than multiple ``str.find()``
  calls. (saves another 300ms) (John Arbash Meinel)

* Policy can be set for each configuration key. This allows keys to be
  inherited properly across configuration entries. For example, this
  should enable you to do::

    [/home/user/project]
    push_location = sftp://host/srv/project/
    push_location:policy = appendpath

  And then a branch like ``/home/user/project/mybranch`` should get an
  automatic push location of ``sftp://host/srv/project/mybranch``.
  (James Henstridge)

* Added ``bzr status --short`` to make status report svn style flags
  for each file.  For example::

    $ bzr status --short
    A  foo
    A  bar
    D  baz
    ?  wooley

* 'bzr selftest --clean-output' allows easily clean temporary tests
  directories without running tests. (Alexander Belchenko)

* ``bzr help hidden-commands`` lists all hidden commands. (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr merge`` now has an option ``--pull`` to fall back to pull if
  local is fully merged into remote. (Jan Hudec)

* ``bzr help formats`` describes available directory formats. (Aaron Bentley)

Internals
*********

* A few tweaks directly to ``fileids_affected_by_revision_ids`` to
  help speed up processing, as well allowing to extract unannotated
  lines. Between the two ``fileids_affected_by_revision_ids`` is
  improved by approx 10%. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Change Revision serialization to only write out millisecond
  resolution. Rather than expecting floating point serialization to
  preserve more resolution than we need. (Henri Weichers, Martin Pool)

* Test suite ends cleanly on Windows.  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* When ``encoding_type`` attribute of class Command is equal to 'exact',
  force sys.stdout to be a binary stream on Windows, and therefore
  keep exact line-endings (without LF -> CRLF conversion).
  (Alexander Belchenko)

* Single-letter short options are no longer globally declared.  (Martin
  Pool)

* Before using detected user/terminal encoding bzr should check
  that Python has corresponding codec. (Alexander Belchenko)

* Formats for end-user selection are provided via a FormatRegistry (Aaron Bentley)

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr missing --verbose`` was showing adds/removals in the wrong
  direction. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr annotate`` now defaults to showing dotted revnos for merged
  revisions. It cuts them off at a depth of 12 characters, but you can
  supply ``--long`` to see the full number. You can also use
  ``--show-ids`` to display the original revision ids, rather than
  revision numbers and committer names. (John Arbash Meinel, #75637)

* bzr now supports Win32 UNC path (e.g. ``\HOST\path``.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #57869)

* Win32-specific: output of cat, bundle and diff commands don't mangle
  line-endings (Alexander Belchenko, #55276)

* Replace broken fnmatch based ignore pattern matching with custom pattern
  matcher.
  (Kent Gibson, Jan Hudec #57637)

* pycurl and urllib can detect short reads at different places. Update
  the test suite to test more cases. Also detect http error code 416
  which was raised for that specific bug. Also enhance the urllib
  robustness by detecting invalid ranges (and pycurl's one by detecting
  short reads during the initial GET). (Vincent Ladeuil, #73948)

* The urllib connection sharing interacts badly with urllib2
  proxy setting (the connections didn't go thru the proxy
  anymore). Defining a proper ProxyHandler solves the
  problem.  (Vincent Ladeuil, #74759)

* Use urlutils to generate relative URLs, not osutils
  (Aaron Bentley, #76229)

* ``bzr status`` in a readonly directory should work without giving
  lots of errors. (John Arbash Meinel, #76299)

* Mention the revisionspec topic for the revision option help.
  (Wouter van Heyst, #31663)

* Allow plugins import from zip archives.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #68124)


bzr 0.13
########

:Released:  2006-12-05

No changes from 0.13rc


bzr 0.13rc1
###########

:Released:  2006-11-27

Improvements
************

* New command ``bzr remove-tree`` allows the removal of the working
  tree from a branch.
  (Daniel Silverstone)

* urllib uses shared keep-alive connections, so http
  operations are substantially faster.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #53654)

* ``bzr export`` allows an optional branch parameter, to export a bzr
  tree from some other url. For example:
  ``bzr export bzr.tar.gz http://bazaar-vcs.org/bzr/bzr.dev``
  (Daniel Silverstone)

* Added ``bzr help topics`` to the bzr help system. This gives a
  location for general information, outside of a specific command.
  This includes updates for ``bzr help revisionspec`` the first topic
  included. (Goffredo Baroncelli, John Arbash Meinel, #42714)

* WSGI-compatible HTTP smart server.  See ``doc/http_smart_server.txt``.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Knit files will now cache full texts only when the size of the
  deltas is as large as the size of the fulltext. (Or after 200
  deltas, whichever comes first). This has the most benefit on large
  files with small changes, such as the inventory for a large project.
  (eg For a project with 2500 files, and 7500 revisions, it changes
  the size of inventory.knit from 11MB to 5.4MB) (John Arbash Meinel)

Internals
*********

* New -D option given before the command line turns on debugging output
  for particular areas.  -Derror shows tracebacks on all errors.
  (Martin Pool)

* Clean up ``bzr selftest --benchmark bundle`` to correct an import,
  and remove benchmarks that take longer than 10min to run.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Use ``time.time()`` instead of ``time.clock()`` to decide on
  progress throttling. Because ``time.clock()`` is actually CPU time,
  so over a high-latency connection, too many updates get throttled.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``MemoryTransport.list_dir()`` would strip the first character for
  files or directories in root directory. (John Arbash Meinel)

* New method ``get_branch_reference`` on 'BzrDir' allows the detection of
  branch references - which the smart server component needs.

* New ``ChrootTransportDecorator``, accessible via the ``chroot+`` url
  prefix.  It disallows any access to locations above a set URL.  (Andrew
  Bennetts)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Now ``_KnitIndex`` properly decode revision ids when loading index data.
  And optimize the knit index parsing code.
  (Dmitry Vasiliev, John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzrlib/bzrdir.py`` was directly referencing ``bzrlib.workingtree``,
  without importing it. This prevented ``bzr upgrade`` from working
  unless a plugin already imported ``bzrlib.workingtree``
  (John Arbash Meinel, #70716)

* Suppress the traceback on invalid URLs (Vincent Ladeuil, #70803).

* Give nicer error message when an http server returns a 403
  error code. (Vincent Ladeuil, #57644).

* When a multi-range http GET request fails, try a single
  range one. If it fails too, forget about ranges. Remember that until
  the death of the transport and propagates that to the clones.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #62276, #62029).

* Handles user/passwords supplied in url from command
  line (for the urllib implementation). Don't request already
  known passwords (Vincent Ladeuil, #42383, #44647, #48527)

* ``_KnitIndex.add_versions()`` dictionary compresses revision ids as they
  are added. This fixes bug where fetching remote revisions records
  them as full references rather than integers.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #64789)

* ``bzr ignore`` strips trailing slashes in patterns.
  Also ``bzr ignore`` rejects absolute paths. (Kent Gibson, #4559)

* ``bzr ignore`` takes multiple arguments. (Cheuksan Edward Wang, #29488)

* mv correctly handles paths that traverse symlinks.
  (Aaron Bentley, #66964)

* Give nicer looking error messages when failing to connect over ssh.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #49172)

* Pushing to a remote branch does not currently update the remote working
  tree. After a remote push, ``bzr status`` and ``bzr diff`` on the remote
  machine now show that the working tree is out of date.
  (Cheuksan Edward Wang #48136)

* Use patiencediff instead of difflib for determining deltas to insert
  into knits. This avoids the O(N^3) behavior of difflib. Patience
  diff should be O(N^2). (Cheuksan Edward Wang, #65714)

* Running ``bzr log`` on nonexistent file gives an error instead of the
  entire log history. (Cheuksan Edward Wang #50793)

* ``bzr cat`` can look up contents of removed or renamed files. If the
  pathname is ambiguous, i.e. the files in the old and new trees have
  different id's, the default is the file in the new tree. The user can
  use "--name-from-revision" to select the file in the old tree.
  (Cheuksan Edward Wang, #30190)

Testing
*******

* TestingHTTPRequestHandler really handles the Range header
  (previously it was ignoring it and returning the whole file,).

bzr 0.12
########

:Released:  2006-10-30

Internals
*********

* Clean up ``bzr selftest --benchmark bundle`` to correct an import,
  and remove benchmarks that take longer than 10min to run.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

bzr 0.12rc1
###########

:Released:  2006-10-23

Improvements
************

* ``bzr log`` now shows dotted-decimal revision numbers for all revisions,
  rather than just showing a decimal revision number for revisions on the
  mainline. These revision numbers are not yet accepted as input into bzr
  commands such as log, diff etc. (Robert Collins)

* revisions can now be specified using dotted-decimal revision numbers.
  For instance, ``bzr diff -r 1.2.1..1.2.3``. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzr help commands`` output is now shorter (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr`` now uses lazy importing to reduce the startup time. This has
  a moderate effect on lots of actions, especially ones that have
  little to do. For example ``bzr rocks`` time is down to 116ms from
  283ms. (John Arbash Meinel)

* New Registry class to provide name-to-object registry-like support,
  for example for schemes where plugins can register new classes to
  do certain tasks (e.g. log formatters). Also provides lazy registration
  to allow modules to be loaded on request.
  (John Arbash Meinel, Adeodato Simó)

API Incompatability
*******************

* LogFormatter subclasses show now expect the 'revno' parameter to
  show() to be a string rather than an int. (Robert Collins)

Internals
*********

* ``TestCase.run_bzr``, ``run_bzr_captured``, and ``run_bzr_subprocess``
  can take a ``working_dir='foo'`` parameter, which will change directory
  for the command. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzrlib.lazy_regex.lazy_compile`` can be used to create a proxy
  around a regex, which defers compilation until first use.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``TestCase.run_bzr_subprocess`` defaults to supplying the
  ``--no-plugins`` parameter to ensure test reproducability, and avoid
  problems with system-wide installed plugins. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Unique tree root ids are now supported. Newly created trees still
  use the common root id for compatibility with bzr versions before 0.12.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``WorkingTree.set_root_id(None)`` is now deprecated. Please
  pass in ``inventory.ROOT_ID`` if you want the default root id value.
  (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)

* New method ``WorkingTree.flush()`` which will write the current memory
  inventory out to disk. At the same time, ``read_working_inventory`` will
  no longer trash the current tree inventory if it has been modified within
  the current lock, and the tree will now ``flush()`` automatically on
  ``unlock()``. ``WorkingTree.set_root_id()`` has been updated to take
  advantage of this functionality. (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzrlib.tsort.merge_sorted`` now accepts ``generate_revnos``. This
  parameter will cause it to add another column to its output, which
  contains the dotted-decimal revno for each revision, as a tuple.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``LogFormatter.show_merge`` is deprecated in favour of
  ``LogFormatter.show_merge_revno``. (Robert Collins)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Avoid circular imports by creating a deprecated function for
  ``bzrlib.tree.RevisionTree``. Callers should have been using
  ``bzrlib.revisontree.RevisionTree`` anyway. (John Arbash Meinel,
  #66349)

* Don't use ``socket.MSG_WAITALL`` as it doesn't exist on all
  platforms. (Martin Pool, #66356)

* Don't require ``Content-Type`` in range responses. Assume they are a
  single range if ``Content-Type`` does not exist.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #62473)

* bzr branch/pull no longer complain about progress bar cleanup when
  interrupted during fetch.  (Aaron Bentley, #54000)

* ``WorkingTree.set_parent_trees()`` uses the trees to directly write
  the basis inventory, rather than going through the repository. This
  allows us to have 1 inventory read, and 2 inventory writes when
  committing a new tree. (John Arbash Meinel)

* When reverting, files that are not locally modified that do not exist
  in the target are deleted, not just unversioned (Aaron Bentley)

* When trying to acquire a lock, don't fail immediately. Instead, try
  a few times (up to 1 hour) before timing out. Also, report why the
  lock is unavailable (John Arbash Meinel, #43521, #49556)

* Leave HttpTransportBase daughter classes decides how they
  implement cloning. (Vincent Ladeuil, #61606)

* diff3 does not indicate conflicts on clean merge. (Aaron Bentley)

* If a commit fails, the commit message is stored in a file at the root of
  the tree for later commit. (Cheuksan Edward Wang, Stefan Metzmacher,
  #32054)

Testing
*******

* New test base class TestCaseWithMemoryTransport offers memory-only
  testing facilities: its not suitable for tests that need to mutate disk
  state, but most tests should not need that and should be converted to
  TestCaseWithMemoryTransport. (Robert Collins)

* ``TestCase.make_branch_and_memory_tree`` now takes a format
  option to set the BzrDir, Repository and Branch formats of the
  created objects. (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)

bzr 0.11

bzr 0.11rc1
###########

:Released:  2006-09-25

Improvements
************

* Knit files now wait to create their contents until the first data is
  added. The old code used to create an empty .knit and a .kndx with just
  the header. However, this caused a lot of extra round trips over sftp.
  This can change the time for ``bzr push`` to create a new remote branch
  from 160s down to 100s. This also affects ``bzr commit`` performance when
  adding new files, ``bzr commit`` on a new kernel-like tree drops from 50s
  down to 40s (John Arbash Meinel, #44692)

* When an entire subtree has been deleted, commit will now report that
  just the top of the subtree has been deleted, rather than reporting
  all the individual items. (Robert Collins)

* Commit performs one less XML parse. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzr checkout`` now operates on readonly branches as well
  as readwrite branches. This fixes bug #39542. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzr bind`` no longer synchronises history with the master branch.
  Binding should be followed by an update or push to synchronise the
  two branches. This is closely related to the fix for bug #39542.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.lazy_import.lazy_import`` function to create on-demand
  objects.  This allows all imports to stay at the global scope, but
  modules will not actually be imported if they are not used.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Support ``bzr://`` and ``bzr+ssh://`` urls to work with the new RPC-based
  transport which will be used with the upcoming high-performance smart
  server. The new command ``bzr serve`` will invoke bzr in server mode,
  which processes these requests. (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins, Martin
  Pool)

* New command ``bzr version-info`` which can be used to get a summary
  of the current state of the tree. This is especially useful as part
  of a build commands. See ``doc/version_info.txt`` for more information
  (John Arbash Meinel)

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``'bzr inventory [FILE...]'`` allows restricting the file list to a
  specific set of files. (John Arbash Meinel, #3631)

* Don't abort when annotating empty files (John Arbash Meinel, #56814)

* Add ``Stanza.to_unicode()`` which can be passed to another Stanza
  when nesting stanzas. Also, add ``read_stanza_unicode`` to handle when
  reading a nested Stanza. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Transform._set_mode() needs to stat the right file.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #56549)

* Raise WeaveFormatError rather than StopIteration when trying to read
  an empty Weave file. (John Arbash Meinel, #46871)

* Don't access e.code for generic URLErrors, only HTTPErrors have .code.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #59835)

* Handle boundary="" lines properly to allow access through a Squid proxy.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #57723)

* revert now removes newly-added directories (Aaron Bentley, #54172)

* ``bzr upgrade sftp://`` shouldn't fail to upgrade v6 branches if there
  isn't a working tree. (David Allouche, #40679)

* Give nicer error messages when a user supplies an invalid --revision
  parameter. (John Arbash Meinel, #55420)

* Handle when LANG is not recognized by python. Emit a warning, but
  just revert to using 'ascii'. (John Arbash Meinel, #35392)

* Don't use ``preexec_fn`` on win32, as it is not supported by subprocess.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Skip specific tests when the dependencies aren't met. This includes
  some ``setup.py`` tests when ``python-dev`` is not available, and
  some tests that depend on paramiko. (John Arbash Meinel, Mattheiu Moy)

* Fallback to Paramiko properly, if no ``ssh`` executable exists on
  the system. (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel)

* ``Branch.bind(other_branch)`` no longer takes a write lock on the
  other branch, and will not push or pull between the two branches.
  API users will need to perform a push or pull or update operation if they
  require branch synchronisation to take place. (Robert Collins, #47344)

* When creating a tarball or zipfile export, export unicode names as utf-8
  paths. This may not work perfectly on all platforms, but has the best
  chance of working in the common case. (John Arbash Meinel, #56816)

* When committing, only files that exist in working tree or basis tree
  may be specified (Aaron Bentley, #50793)

Portability
***********

* Fixes to run on Python 2.5 (Brian M. Carlson, Martin Pool, Marien Zwart)

Internals
*********

* TestCaseInTempDir now creates a separate directory for HOME, rather
  than having HOME set to the same location as the working directory.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``run_bzr_subprocess()`` can take an optional ``env_changes={}`` parameter,
  which will update os.environ inside the spawned child. It also can
  take a ``universal_newlines=True``, which helps when checking the output
  of the command. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Refactor SFTP vendors to allow easier re-use when ssh is used.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``Transport.list_dir()`` and ``Transport.iter_files_recursive()`` should always
  return urlescaped paths. This is now tested (there were bugs in a few
  of the transports) (Andrew Bennetts, David Allouche, John Arbash Meinel)

* New utility function ``symbol_versioning.deprecation_string``. Returns the
  formatted string for a callable, deprecation format pair. (Robert Collins)

* New TestCase helper applyDeprecated. This allows you to call a callable
  which is deprecated without it spewing to the screen, just by supplying
  the deprecation format string issued for it. (Robert Collins)

* Transport.append and Transport.put have been deprecated in favor of
  ``.append_bytes``, ``.append_file``, ``.put_bytes``, and
  ``.put_file``. This removes the ambiguity in what type of object the
  functions take.  ``Transport.non_atomic_put_{bytes,file}`` has also
  been added. Which works similarly to ``Transport.append()`` except for
  SFTP, it doesn't have a round trip when opening the file. Also, it
  provides functionality for creating a parent directory when trying
  to create a file, rather than raise NoSuchFile and forcing the
  caller to repeat their request.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* WorkingTree has a new api ``unversion`` which allow the unversioning of
  entries by their file id. (Robert Collins)

* ``WorkingTree.pending_merges`` is deprecated.  Please use the
  ``get_parent_ids`` (introduced in 0.10) method instead. (Robert Collins)

* WorkingTree has a new ``lock_tree_write`` method which locks the branch for
  read rather than write. This is appropriate for actions which only need
  the branch data for reference rather than mutation. A new decorator
  ``needs_tree_write_lock`` is provided in the workingtree module. Like the
  ``needs_read_lock`` and ``needs_write_lock`` decorators this allows static
  declaration of the locking requirements of a function to ensure that
  a lock is taken out for casual scripts. (Robert Collins, #54107)

* All WorkingTree methods which write to the tree, but not to the branch
  have been converted to use ``needs_tree_write_lock`` rather than
  ``needs_write_lock``. Also converted is the revert, conflicts and tree
  transform modules. This provides a modest performance improvement on
  metadir style trees, due to the reduce lock-acquisition, and a more
  significant performance improvement on lightweight checkouts from
  remote branches, where trivial operations used to pay a significant
  penalty. It also provides the basis for allowing readonly checkouts.
  (Robert Collins)

* Special case importing the standard library 'copy' module. This shaves
  off 40ms of startup time, while retaining compatibility. See:
  ``bzrlib/inspect_for_copy.py`` for more details. (John Arbash Meinel)

* WorkingTree has a new parent class MutableTree which represents the
  specialisations of Tree which are able to be altered. (Robert Collins)

* New methods mkdir and ``put_file_bytes_non_atomic`` on MutableTree that
  mutate the tree and its contents. (Robert Collins)

* Transport behaviour at the root of the URL is now defined and tested.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

Testing
*******

* New test helper classs MemoryTree. This is typically accessed via
  ``self.make_branch_and_memory_tree()`` in test cases. (Robert Collins)

* Add ``start_bzr_subprocess`` and ``stop_bzr_subprocess`` to allow test
  code to continue running concurrently with a subprocess of bzr.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* Add a new method ``Transport.get_smart_client()``. This is provided to
  allow upgrades to a richer interface than the VFS one provided by
  Transport. (Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool)

bzr 0.10
########

:Released:  2006-08-29

Improvements
************
* 'merge' now takes --uncommitted, to apply uncommitted changes from a
  tree.  (Aaron Bentley)

* 'bzr add --file-ids-from' can be used to specify another path to use
  for creating file ids, rather than generating all new ones. Internally,
  the 'action' passed to ``smart_add_tree()`` can return ``file_ids`` that
  will be used, rather than having bzrlib generate new ones.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #55781)

* ``bzr selftest --benchmark`` now allows a ``--cache-dir`` parameter.
  This will cache some of the intermediate trees, and decrease the
  setup time for benchmark tests. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Inverse forms are provided for all boolean options.  For example,
  --strict has --no-strict, --no-recurse has --recurse (Aaron Bentley)

* Serialize out Inventories directly, rather than using ElementTree.
  Writing out a kernel sized inventory drops from 2s down to ~350ms.
  (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Help diffutils 2.8.4 get along with binary tests (Marien Zwart: #57614)

* Change LockDir so that if the lock directory doesn't exist when
  ``lock_write()`` is called, an attempt will be made to create it.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #56974)

* ``bzr uncommit`` preserves pending merges. (John Arbash Meinel, #57660)

* Active FTP transport now works as intended. (ghozzy, #56472)

* Really fix mutter() so that it won't ever raise a UnicodeError.
  It means it is possible for ~/.bzr.log to contain non UTF-8 characters.
  But it is a debugging log, not a real user file.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #56947, #53880)

* Change Command handle to allow Unicode command and options.
  At present we cannot register Unicode command names, so we will get
  BzrCommandError('unknown command'), or BzrCommandError('unknown option')
  But that is better than a UnicodeError + a traceback.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #57123)

* Handle TZ=UTC properly when reading/writing revisions.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #55783, #56290)

* Use ``GPG_TTY`` to allow gpg --cl to work with gpg-agent in a pipeline,
  (passing text to sign in on stdin). (John Arbash Meinel, #54468)

* External diff does the right thing for binaries even in foreign
  languages. (John Arbash Meinel, #56307)

* Testament handles more cases when content is unicode. Specific bug was
  in handling of revision properties.
  (John Arbash Meinel, Holger Krekel, #54723)

* The bzr selftest was failing on installed versions due to a bug in a new
  test helper. (John Arbash Meinel, Robert Collins, #58057)

Internals
*********

* ``bzrlib.cache_utf8`` contains ``encode()`` and ``decode()`` functions
  which can be used to cache the conversion between utf8 and Unicode.
  Especially helpful for some of the knit annotation code, which has to
  convert revision ids to utf8 to annotate lines in storage.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``setup.py`` now searches the filesystem to find all packages which
  need to be installed. This should help make the life of packagers
  easier. (John Arbash Meinel)

bzr 0.9.0
#########

:Released:  2006-08-11

Surprises
*********

* The hard-coded built-in ignore rules have been removed. There are
  now two rulesets which are enforced. A user global one in
  ``~/.bazaar/ignore`` which will apply to every tree, and the tree
  specific one '.bzrignore'.
  ``~/.bazaar/ignore`` will be created if it does not exist, but with
  a more conservative list than the old default.
  This fixes bugs with default rules being enforced no matter what.
  The old list of ignore rules from bzr is available by
  running 'bzr ignore --old-default-rules'.
  (Robert Collins, Martin Pool, John Arbash Meinel)

* 'branches.conf' has been changed to 'locations.conf', since it can apply
  to more locations than just branch locations.
  (Aaron Bentley)

Improvements
************

* The revision specifier "revno:" is extended to accept the syntax
  revno:N:branch. For example,
  revno:42:http://bazaar-vcs.org/bzr/bzr.dev/ means revision 42 in
  bzr.dev.  (Matthieu Moy)

* Tests updates to ensure proper URL handling, UNICODE support, and
  proper printing when the user's terminal encoding cannot display
  the path of a file that has been versioned.
  ``bzr branch`` can take a target URL rather than only a local directory.
  ``Branch.get_parent()/set_parent()`` now save a relative path if possible,
  and normalize the parent based on root, allowing access across
  different transports. (John Arbash Meinel, Wouter van Heyst, Martin Pool)
  (Malone #48906, #42699, #40675, #5281, #3980, #36363, #43689,
  #42517, #42514)

* On Unix, detect terminal width using an ioctl not just $COLUMNS.
  Use terminal width for single-line logs from ``bzr log --line`` and
  pending-merge display.  (Robert Widhopf-Fenk, Gustavo Niemeyer)
  (Malone #3507)

* On Windows, detect terminal width using GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

* Speedup improvement for 'date:'-revision search. (Guillaume Pinot).

* Show the correct number of revisions pushed when pushing a new branch.
  (Robert Collins).

* 'bzr selftest' now shows a progress bar with the number of tests, and
  progress made. 'make check' shows tests in -v mode, to be more useful
  for the PQM status window. (Robert Collins).
  When using a progress bar, failed tests are printed out, rather than
  being overwritten by the progress bar until the suite finishes.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* 'bzr selftest --benchmark' will run a new benchmarking selftest.
  'bzr selftest --benchmark --lsprof-timed' will use lsprofile to generate
  profile data for the individual profiled calls, allowing for fine
  grained analysis of performance.
  (Robert Collins, Martin Pool).

* 'bzr commit' shows a progress bar. This is useful for commits over sftp
  where commit can take an appreciable time. (Robert Collins)

* 'bzr add' is now less verbose in telling you what ignore globs were
  matched by files being ignored. Instead it just tells you how many
  were ignored (because you might reasonably be expecting none to be
  ignored). 'bzr add -v' is unchanged and will report every ignored
  file. (Robert Collins).

* ftp now has a test server if medusa is installed. As part of testing,
  ftp support has been improved, including support for supplying a
  non-standard port. (John Arbash Meinel).

* 'bzr log --line' shows the revision number, and uses only the
  first line of the log message (#5162, Alexander Belchenko;
  Matthieu Moy)

* 'bzr status' has had the --all option removed. The 'bzr ls' command
  should be used to retrieve all versioned files. (Robert Collins)

* 'bzr bundle OTHER/BRANCH' will create a bundle which can be sent
  over email, and applied on the other end, while maintaining ancestry.
  This bundle can be applied with either 'bzr merge' or 'bzr pull',
  the same way you would apply another branch.
  (John Arbash Meinel, Aaron Bentley)

* 'bzr whoami' can now be used to set your identity from the command line,
  for a branch or globally.  (Robey Pointer)

* 'bzr checkout' now aliased to 'bzr co', and 'bzr annotate' to 'bzr ann'.
  (Michael Ellerman)

* 'bzr revert DIRECTORY' now reverts the contents of the directory as well.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* 'bzr get sftp://foo' gives a better error when paramiko is not present.
  Also updates things like 'http+pycurl://' if pycurl is not present.
  (John Arbash Meinel) (Malone #47821, #52204)

* New env variable ``BZR_PROGRESS_BAR``, sets the default progress bar type.
  Can be set to 'none' or 'dummy' to disable the progress bar, 'dots' or
  'tty' to create the respective type. (John Arbash Meinel, #42197, #51107)

* Improve the help text for 'bzr diff' to explain what various options do.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #6391)

* 'bzr uncommit -r 10' now uncommits revisions 11.. rather than uncommitting
  revision 10. This makes -r10 more in line with what other commands do.
  'bzr uncommit' also now saves the pending merges of the revisions that
  were removed. So it is safe to uncommit after a merge, fix something,
  and commit again. (John Arbash Meinel, #32526, #31426)

* 'bzr init' now also works on remote locations.
  (Wouter van Heyst, #48904)

* HTTP support has been updated. When using pycurl we now support
  connection keep-alive, which reduces dns requests and round trips.
  And for both urllib and pycurl we support multi-range requests,
  which decreases the number of round-trips. Performance results for
  ``bzr branch http://bazaar-vcs.org/bzr/bzr.dev/`` indicate
  http branching is now 2-3x faster, and ``bzr pull`` in an existing
  branch is as much as 4x faster.
  (Michael Ellerman, Johan Rydberg, John Arbash Meinel, #46768)

* Performance improvements for sftp. Branching and pulling are now up to
  2x faster. Utilize paramiko.readv() support for async requests if it
  is available (paramiko > 1.6) (John Arbash Meinel)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix shadowed definition of TestLocationConfig that caused some
  tests not to run.
  (Erik Bågfors, Michael Ellerman, Martin Pool, #32587)

* Fix unnecessary requirement of sign-my-commits that it be run from
  a working directory.  (Martin Pool, Robert Collins)

* 'bzr push location' will only remember the push location if it succeeds
  in connecting to the remote location. (John Arbash Meinel, #49742)

* 'bzr revert' no longer toggles the executable bit on win32
  (John Arbash Meinel, #45010)

* Handle broken pipe under win32 correctly. (John Arbash Meinel)

* sftp tests now work correctly on win32 if you have a newer paramiko
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Cleanup win32 test suite, and general cleanup of places where
  file handles were being held open. (John Arbash Meinel)

* When specifying filenames for 'diff -r x..y', the name of the file in the
  working directory can be used, even if its name is different in both x
  and y.

* File-ids containing single- or double-quotes are handled correctly by
  push. (Aaron Bentley, #52227)

* Normalize unicode filenames to ensure cross-platform consistency.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #43689)

* The argument parser can now handle '-' as an argument. Currently
  no code interprets it specially (it is mostly handled as a file named
  '-'). But plugins, and future operations can use it.
  (John Arbash meinel, #50984)

* Bundles can properly read binary files with a plain '\r' in them.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #51927)

* Tuning ``iter_entries()`` to be more efficient (John Arbash Meinel, #5444)

* Lots of win32 fixes (the test suite passes again).
  (John Arbash Meinel, #50155)

* Handle openbsd returning None for sys.getfilesystemencoding() (#41183)

* Support ftp APPE (append) to allow Knits to be used over ftp (#42592)

* Removals are only committed if they match the filespec (or if there is
  no filespec).  (#46635, Aaron Bentley)

* smart-add recurses through all supplied directories
  (John Arbash Meinel, #52578)

* Make the bundle reader extra lines before and after the bundle text.
  This allows you to parse an email with the bundle inline.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #49182)

* Change the file id generator to squash a little bit more. Helps when
  working with long filenames on windows. (Also helps for unicode filenames
  not generating hidden files). (John Arbash Meinel, #43801)

* Restore terminal mode on C-c while reading sftp password.  (#48923,
  Nicholas Allen, Martin Pool)

* Timestamps are rounded to 1ms, and revision entries can be recreated
  exactly. (John Arbash Meinel, Jamie Wilkinson, #40693)

* Branch.base has changed to a URL, but ~/.bazaar/locations.conf should
  use local paths, since it is user visible (John Arbash Meinel, #53653)

* ``bzr status foo`` when foo was unversioned used to cause a full delta
  to be generated (John Arbash Meinel, #53638)

* When reading revision properties, an empty value should be considered
  the empty string, not None (John Arbash Meinel, #47782)

* ``bzr diff --diff-options`` can now handle binary files being changed.
  Also, the output is consistent when --diff-options is not supplied.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #54651, #52930)

* Use the right suffixes for loading plugins (John Arbash Meinel, #51810)

* Fix ``Branch.get_parent()`` to handle the case when the parent is not
  accessible (John Arbash Meinel, #52976)

Internals
*********

* Combine the ignore rules into a single regex rather than looping over
  them to reduce the threshold where  N^2 behaviour occurs in operations
  like status. (Jan Hudec, Robert Collins).

* Appending to ``bzrlib.DEFAULT_IGNORE`` is now deprecated. Instead, use
  one of the add functions in bzrlib.ignores. (John Arbash Meinel)

* 'bzr push' should only push the ancestry of the current revision, not
  all of the history in the repository. This is especially important for
  shared repositories. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzrlib.delta.compare_trees`` now iterates in alphabetically sorted order,
  rather than randomly walking the inventories. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Doctests are now run in temporary directories which are cleaned up when
  they finish, rather than using special ScratchDir/ScratchBranch objects.
  (Martin Pool)

* Split ``check`` into separate methods on the branch and on the repository,
  so that it can be specialized in ways that are useful or efficient for
  different formats.  (Martin Pool, Robert Collins)

* Deprecate ``Repository.all_revision_ids``; most methods don't really need
  the global revision graph but only that part leading up to a particular
  revision.  (Martin Pool, Robert Collins)

* Add a BzrDirFormat ``control_formats`` list which allows for control formats
  that do not use '.bzr' to store their data - i.e. '.svn', '.hg' etc.
  (Robert Collins, Jelmer Vernooij).

* ``bzrlib.diff.external_diff`` can be redirected to any file-like object.
  Uses subprocess instead of spawnvp.
  (James Henstridge, John Arbash Meinel, #4047, #48914)

* New command line option '--profile-imports', which will install a custom
  importer to log time to import modules and regex compilation time to
  sys.stderr (John Arbash Meinel)

* 'EmptyTree' is now deprecated, please use ``repository.revision_tree(None)``
  instead. (Robert Collins)

* "RevisionTree" is now in bzrlib/revisiontree.py. (Robert Collins)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix failure to commit a merge in a checkout.  (Martin Pool,

* Separate functionality from assert statements as they are skipped in
  optimized mode of python. Add the same check to pending merges.
  (Olaf Conradi, #44443)

* Add info on standalone branches without a working tree.
  (Olaf Conradi, #44155)

* Fix bug in knits when raising InvalidRevisionId. (Olaf Conradi, #44284)

Changes
*******

  alternatives system. If that all fails, fall back to the pre-defined
  list of editors. (Olaf Conradi, #42904)

New Features
************

* New 'register-branch' command registers a public branch into
  Launchpad.net, where it can be associated with bugs, etc.
  (Martin Pool, Bjorn Tillenius, Robert Collins)

Internals
*********

* New public api in InventoryEntry - ``describe_change(old, new)`` which
  provides a human description of the changes between two old and
  new. (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

Testing
*******

* Fix test case for bzr info in upgrading a standalone branch to metadir,
  uses bzrlib api now. (Olaf Conradi)

bzr 0.8
#######

:Released:  2006-05-08

Notes When Upgrading
********************

Release 0.8 of bzr introduces a new format for history storage, called
'knit', as an evolution of to the 'weave' format used in 0.7.  Local
and remote operations are faster using knits than weaves.  Several
operations including 'init', 'init-repo', and 'upgrade' take a
--format option that controls this.  Branching from an existing branch
will keep the same format.

It is possible to merge, pull and push between branches of different
formats but this is slower than moving data between homogenous
branches.  It is therefore recommended (but not required) that you
upgrade all branches for a project at the same time.  Information on
formats is shown by 'bzr info'.

bzr 0.8 now allows creation of 'repositories', which hold the history
of files and revisions for several branches.  Previously bzr kept all
the history for a branch within the .bzr directory at the root of the
branch, and this is still the default.  To create a repository, use
the new 'bzr init-repo' command.  Branches exist as directories under
the repository and contain just a small amount of information
indicating the current revision of the branch.

bzr 0.8 also supports 'checkouts', which are similar to in cvs and
subversion.  Checkouts are associated with a branch (optionally in a
repository), which contains all the historical information.  The
result is that a checkout can be deleted without losing any
already-committed revisions.  A new 'update' command is also available.

Repositories and checkouts are not supported with the 0.7 storage
format.  To use them you must upgrad to either knits, or to the
'metaweave' format, which uses weaves but changes the .bzr directory
arrangement.


Improvements
************

* sftp paths can now be relative, or local, according to the lftp
  convention. Paths now take the form::

      sftp://user:pass@host:port/~/relative/path
      or
      sftp://user:pass@host:port/absolute/path

* The FTP transport now tries to reconnect after a temporary
  failure. ftp put is made atomic. (Matthieu Moy)

* The FTP transport now maintains a pool of connections, and
  reuses them to avoid multiple connections to the same host (like
  sftp did). (Daniel Silverstone)

* The ``bzr_man.py`` file has been removed. To create the man page now,
  use ``./generate_docs.py man``. The new program can also create other files.
  Run ``python generate_docs.py --help`` for usage information.
  (Hans Ulrich Niedermann & James Blackwell).

* Man Page now gives full help (James Blackwell).
  Help also updated to reflect user config now being stored in .bazaar
  (Hans Ulrich Niedermann)

* It's now possible to set aliases in bazaar.conf (Erik Bågfors)

* Pull now accepts a --revision argument (Erik Bågfors)

* ``bzr re-sign`` now allows multiple revisions to be supplied on the command
  line. You can now use the following command to sign all of your old
  commits::

    find .bzr/revision-store// -name my@email-* \
      | sed 's/.*\/\/..\///' \
      | xargs bzr re-sign

* Upgrade can now upgrade over the network. (Robert Collins)

* Two new commands 'bzr checkout' and 'bzr update' allow for CVS/SVN-alike
  behaviour.  By default they will cache history in the checkout, but
  with --lightweight almost all data is kept in the master branch.
  (Robert Collins)

* 'revert' unversions newly-versioned files, instead of deleting them.

* 'merge' is more robust.  Conflict messages have changed.

* 'merge' and 'revert' no longer clobber existing files that end in '~' or
  '.moved'.

* Default log format can be set in configuration and plugins can register
  their own formatters. (Erik Bågfors)

* New 'reconcile' command will check branch consistency and repair indexes
  that can become out of sync in pre 0.8 formats. (Robert Collins,
  Daniel Silverstone)

* New 'bzr init --format' and 'bzr upgrade --format' option to control
  what storage format is created or produced.  (Robert Collins,
  Martin Pool)

* Add parent location to 'bzr info', if there is one.  (Olaf Conradi)

* New developer commands 'weave-list' and 'weave-join'.  (Martin Pool)

* New 'init-repository' command, plus support for repositories in 'init'
  and 'branch' (Aaron Bentley, Erik Bågfors, Robert Collins)

* Improve output of 'info' command. Show all relevant locations related to
  working tree, branch and repository. Use kibibytes for binary quantities.
  Fix off-by-one error in missing revisions of working tree.  Make 'info'
  work on branches, repositories and remote locations.  Show locations
  relative to the shared repository, if applicable.  Show locking status
  of locations.  (Olaf Conradi)

* Diff and merge now safely handle binary files. (Aaron Bentley)

* 'pull' and 'push' now normalise the revision history, so that any two
  branches with the same tip revision will have the same output from 'log'.
  (Robert Collins)

* 'merge' accepts --remember option to store parent location, like 'push'
  and 'pull'. (Olaf Conradi)

* bzr status and diff when files given as arguments do not exist
  in the relevant trees.  (Martin Pool, #3619)

* Add '.hg' to the default ignore list.  (Martin Pool)

* 'knit' is now the default disk format. This improves disk performance and
  utilization, increases incremental pull performance, robustness with SFTP
  and allows checkouts over SFTP to perform acceptably.
  The initial Knit code was contributed by Johan Rydberg based on a
  specification by Martin Pool.
  (Robert Collins, Aaron Bentley, Johan Rydberg, Martin Pool).

* New tool to generate all-in-one html version of the manual.  (Alexander
  Belchenko)

* Hitting CTRL-C while doing an SFTP push will no longer cause stale locks
  to be left in the SFTP repository. (Robert Collins, Martin Pool).

* New option 'diff --prefix' to control how files are named in diff
  output, with shortcuts '-p0' and '-p1' corresponding to the options for
  GNU patch.  (Alexander Belchenko, Goffredo Baroncelli, Martin Pool)

* Add --revision option to 'annotate' command.  (Olaf Conradi)

* If bzr shows an unexpected revision-history after pulling (perhaps due
  to a reweave) it can now be corrected by 'bzr reconcile'.
  (Robert Collins)

Changes
*******

* Commit is now verbose by default, and shows changed filenames and the
  new revision number.  (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

* Unify 'mv', 'move', 'rename'.  (Matthew Fuller, #5379)

* 'bzr -h' shows help.  (Martin Pool, Ian Bicking, #35940)

* Make 'pull' and 'push' remember location on failure using --remember.
  (Olaf Conradi)

* For compatibility, make old format for using weaves inside metadir
  available as 'metaweave' format.  Rename format 'metadir' to 'default'.
  Clean up help for option --format in commands 'init', 'init-repo' and
  'upgrade'.  (Olaf Conradi)

Internals
*********

* The internal storage of history, and logical branch identity have now
  been split into Branch, and Repository. The common locking and file
  management routines are now in bzrlib.lockablefiles.
  (Aaron Bentley, Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

* Transports can now raise DependencyNotPresent if they need a library
  which is not installed, and then another implementation will be
  tried.  (Martin Pool)

* Remove obsolete (and no-op) `decode` parameter to `Transport.get`.
  (Martin Pool)

* Using Tree Transform for merge, revert, tree-building

* WorkingTree.create, Branch.create, ``WorkingTree.create_standalone``,
  Branch.initialize are now deprecated. Please see ``BzrDir.create_*`` for
  replacement API's. (Robert Collins)

* New BzrDir class represents the .bzr control directory and manages
  formatting issues. (Robert Collins)

* New repository.InterRepository class encapsulates Repository to
  Repository actions and allows for clean selection of optimised code
  paths. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.fetch.fetch`` and ``bzrlib.fetch.greedy_fetch`` are now
  deprecated, please use ``branch.fetch`` or ``repository.fetch``
  depending on your needs. (Robert Collins)

* deprecated methods now have a ``is_deprecated`` flag on them that can
  be checked, if you need to determine whether a given callable is
  deprecated at runtime. (Robert Collins)

* Progress bars are now nested - see
  ``bzrlib.ui.ui_factory.nested_progress_bar``.
  (Robert Collins, Robey Pointer)

* New API call ``get_format_description()`` for each type of format.
  (Olaf Conradi)

* Changed ``branch.set_parent()`` to accept None to remove parent.
  (Olaf Conradi)

* Deprecated BzrError AmbiguousBase.  (Olaf Conradi)

* WorkingTree.branch is now a read only property.  (Robert Collins)

* bzrlib.ui.text.TextUIFactory now accepts a ``bar_type`` parameter which
  can be None or a factory that will create a progress bar. This is
  useful for testing or for overriding the bzrlib.progress heuristic.
  (Robert Collins)

* New API method ``get_physical_lock_status()`` to query locks present on a
  transport.  (Olaf Conradi)

* Repository.reconcile now takes a thorough keyword parameter to allow
  requesting an indepth reconciliation, rather than just a data-loss
  check. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.ui.ui_factory protocol`` now supports ``get_boolean`` to prompt
  the user for yes/no style input. (Robert Collins)

Testing
*******

* SFTP tests now shortcut the SSH negotiation, reducing test overhead
  for testing SFTP protocol support. (Robey Pointer)

* Branch formats are now tested once per implementation (see ``bzrlib.
  tests.branch_implementations``. This is analagous to the transport
  interface tests, and has been followed up with working tree,
  repository and BzrDir tests. (Robert Collins)

* New test base class TestCaseWithTransport provides a transport aware
  test environment, useful for testing any transport-interface using
  code. The test suite option --transport controls the transport used
  by this class (when its not being used as part of implementation
  contract testing). (Robert Collins)

* Close logging handler on disabling the test log. This will remove the
  handler from the internal list inside python's logging module,
  preventing shutdown from closing it twice.  (Olaf Conradi)

* Move test case for uncommit to blackbox tests.  (Olaf Conradi)

* ``run_bzr`` and ``run_bzr_captured`` now accept a 'stdin="foo"'
  parameter which will provide String("foo") to the command as its stdin.

bzr 0.7
#######

:Released: 2006-01-09

Changes
*******

* .bzrignore is excluded from exports, on the grounds that it's a bzr
  internal-use file and may not be wanted.  (Jamie Wilkinson)

* The "bzr directories" command were removed in favor of the new
  --kind option to the "bzr inventory" command.  To list all
  versioned directories, now use "bzr inventory --kind directory".
  (Johan Rydberg)

* Under Windows configuration directory is now ``%APPDATA%\bazaar\2.0``
  by default. (John Arbash Meinel)

* The parent of Bzr configuration directory can be set by ``BZR_HOME``
  environment variable. Now the path for it is searched in ``BZR_HOME``,
  then in HOME. Under Windows the order is: ``BZR_HOME``, ``APPDATA``
  (usually points to ``C:\Documents and Settings\User Name\Application Data``),
  ``HOME``. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Plugins with the same name in different directories in the bzr plugin
  path are no longer loaded: only the first successfully loaded one is
  used. (Robert Collins)

* Use systems' external ssh command to open connections if possible.
  This gives better integration with user settings such as ProxyCommand.
  (James Henstridge)

* Permissions on files underneath .bzr/ are inherited from the .bzr
  directory. So for a shared repository, simply doing 'chmod -R g+w .bzr/'
  will mean that future file will be created with group write permissions.

* configure.in and config.guess are no longer in the builtin default
  ignore list.

* '.sw[nop]' pattern ignored, to ignore vim swap files for nameless
  files.  (John Arbash Meinel, Martin Pool)

Improvements
************

* "bzr INIT dir" now initializes the specified directory, and creates
  it if it does not exist.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* New remerge command (Aaron Bentley)

* Better zsh completion script.  (Steve Borho)

* 'bzr diff' now returns 1 when there are changes in the working
  tree. (Robert Collins)

* 'bzr push' now exists and can push changes to a remote location.
  This uses the transport infrastructure, and can store the remote
  location in the ~/.bazaar/branches.conf configuration file.
  (Robert Collins)

* Test directories are only kept if the test fails and the user requests
  that they be kept.

* Tweaks to short log printing

* Added branch nicks, new nick command, printing them in log output.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* If ``$BZR_PDB`` is set, pop into the debugger when an uncaught exception
  occurs.  (Martin Pool)

* Accept 'bzr resolved' (an alias for 'bzr resolve'), as this is
  the same as Subversion.  (Martin Pool)

* New ftp transport support (on ftplib), for ftp:// and aftp://
  URLs.  (Daniel Silverstone)

* Commit editor temporary files now start with ``bzr_log.``, to allow
  text editors to match the file name and set up appropriate modes or
  settings.  (Magnus Therning)

* Improved performance when integrating changes from a remote weave.
  (Goffredo Baroncelli)

* Sftp will attempt to cache the connection, so it is more likely that
  a connection will be reused, rather than requiring multiple password
  requests.

* bzr revno now takes an optional argument indicating the branch whose
  revno should be printed.  (Michael Ellerman)

* bzr cat defaults to printing the last version of the file.
  (Matthieu Moy, #3632)

* New global option 'bzr --lsprof COMMAND' runs bzr under the lsprof
  profiler.  (Denys Duchier)

* Faster commits by reading only the headers of affected weave files.
  (Denys Duchier)

* 'bzr add' now takes a --dry-run parameter which shows you what would be
  added, but doesn't actually add anything. (Michael Ellerman)

* 'bzr add' now lists how many files were ignored per glob.  add --verbose
  lists the specific files.  (Aaron Bentley)

* 'bzr missing' now supports displaying changes in diverged trees and can
  be limited to show what either end of the comparison is missing.
  (Aaron Bently, with a little prompting from Daniel Silverstone)

Bug Fixes
*********

* SFTP can walk up to the root path without index errors. (Robert Collins)

* Fix bugs in running bzr with 'python -O'.  (Martin Pool)

* Error when run with -OO

* Fix bug in reporting http errors that don't have an http error code.
  (Martin Pool)

* Handle more cases of pipe errors in display commands

* Change status to 3 for all errors

* Files that are added and unlinked before committing are completely
  ignored by diff and status

* Stores with some compressed texts and some uncompressed texts are now
  able to be used. (John A Meinel)

* Fix for bzr pull failing sometimes under windows

* Fix for sftp transport under windows when using interactive auth

* Show files which are both renamed and modified as such in 'bzr
  status' output.  (Daniel Silverstone, #4503)

* Make annotate cope better with revisions committed without a valid
  email address.  (Marien Zwart)

* Fix representation of tab characters in commit messages.
  (Harald Meland)

* List of plugin directories in ``BZR_PLUGIN_PATH`` environment variable is
  now parsed properly under Windows. (Alexander Belchenko)

* Show number of revisions pushed/pulled/merged. (Robey Pointer)

* Keep a cached copy of the basis inventory to speed up operations
  that need to refer to it.  (Johan Rydberg, Martin Pool)

* Fix bugs in bzr status display of non-ascii characters.
  (Martin Pool)

* Remove Makefile.in from default ignore list.
  (Tollef Fog Heen, Martin Pool, #6413)

* Fix failure in 'bzr added'.  (Nathan McCallum, Martin Pool)

Testing
*******

* Fix selftest asking for passwords when there are no SFTP keys.
  (Robey Pointer, Jelmer Vernooij)

* Fix selftest run with 'python -O'.  (Martin Pool)

* Fix HTTP tests under Windows. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Make tests work even if HOME is not set (Aaron Bentley)

* Updated ``build_tree`` to use fixed line-endings for tests which read
  the file cotents and compare. Make some tests use this to pass under
  Windows. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Skip stat and symlink tests under Windows. (Alexander Belchenko)

* Delay in selftest/testhashcash is now issued under win32 and Cygwin.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Use terminal width to align verbose test output.  (Martin Pool)

* Blackbox tests are maintained within the bzrlib.tests.blackbox directory.
  If adding a new test script please add that to
  ``bzrlib.tests.blackbox.__init__``. (Robert Collins)

* Much better error message if one of the test suites can't be
  imported.  (Martin Pool)

* Make check now runs the test suite twice - once with the default locale,
  and once with all locales forced to C, to expose bugs. This is not
  trivially done within python, so for now its only triggered by running
  Make check. Integrators and packagers who wish to check for full
  platform support should run 'make check' to test the source.
  (Robert Collins)

* Tests can now run TestSkipped if they can't execute for any reason.
  (Martin Pool) (NB: TestSkipped should only be raised for correctable
  reasons - see the wiki spec ImprovingBzrTestSuite).

* Test sftp with relative, absolute-in-homedir and absolute-not-in-homedir
  paths for the transport tests. Introduce blackbox remote sftp tests that
  test the same permutations. (Robert Collins, Robey Pointer)

* Transport implementation tests are now independent of the local file
  system, which allows tests for esoteric transports, and for features
  not available in the local file system. They also repeat for variations
  on the URL scheme that can introduce issues in the transport code,
  see bzrlib.transport.TransportTestProviderAdapter() for this.
  (Robert Collins).

* ``TestCase.build_tree`` uses the transport interface to build trees,
  pass in a transport parameter to give it an existing connection.
  (Robert Collins).

Internals
*********

* WorkingTree.pull has been split across Branch and WorkingTree,
  to allow Branch only pulls. (Robert Collins)

* ``commands.display_command`` now returns the result of the decorated
  function. (Robert Collins)

* LocationConfig now has a ``set_user_option(key, value)`` call to save
  a setting in its matching location section (a new one is created
  if needed). (Robert Collins)

* Branch has two new methods, ``get_push_location`` and
  ``set_push_location`` to respectively, get and set the push location.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``commands.register_command`` now takes an optional flag to signal that
  the registrant is planning to decorate an existing command. When
  given multiple plugins registering a command is not an error, and
  the original command class (whether built in or a plugin based one) is
  returned to the caller. There is a new error 'MustUseDecorated' for
  signalling when a wrapping command should switch to the original
  version. (Robert Collins)

* Some option parsing errors will raise 'BzrOptionError', allowing
  granular detection for decorating commands. (Robert Collins).

* ``Branch.read_working_inventory`` has moved to
  ``WorkingTree.read_working_inventory``. This necessitated changes to
  ``Branch.get_root_id``, and a move of ``Branch.set_inventory`` to
  WorkingTree as well. To make it clear that a WorkingTree cannot always
  be obtained ``Branch.working_tree()`` will raise
  ``errors.NoWorkingTree`` if one cannot be obtained. (Robert Collins)

* All pending merges operations from Branch are now on WorkingTree.
  (Robert Collins)

* The follow operations from Branch have moved to WorkingTree::

      add()
      commit()
      move()
      rename_one()
      unknowns()

  (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.add.smart_add_branch`` is now ``smart_add_tree``. (Robert Collins)

* New "rio" serialization format, similar to rfc-822. (Martin Pool)

* Rename selftests to ``bzrlib.tests.test_foo``.  (John A Meinel, Martin
  Pool)

* ``bzrlib.plugin.all_plugins`` has been changed from an attribute to a
  query method. (Robert Collins)

* New options to read only the table-of-contents of a weave.
  (Denys Duchier)

* Raise NoSuchFile when someone tries to add a non-existant file.
  (Michael Ellerman)

* Simplify handling of DivergedBranches in ``cmd_pull()``.
  (Michael Ellerman)

* Branch.controlfile* logic has moved to lockablefiles.LockableFiles, which
  is exposed as ``Branch().control_files``. Also this has been altered with the
  controlfile pre/suffix replaced by simple method names like 'get' and
  'put'. (Aaron Bentley, Robert Collins).

* Deprecated functions and methods can now be marked as such using the
  ``bzrlib.symbol_versioning`` module. Marked method have their docstring
  updated and will issue a DeprecationWarning using the warnings module
  when they are used. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzrlib.osutils.safe_unicode`` now exists to provide parameter coercion
  for functions that need unicode strings. (Robert Collins)

bzr 0.6
#######

:Released: 2005-10-28

Improvements
************

* pull now takes --verbose to show you what revisions are added or removed
  (John A Meinel)

* merge now takes a --show-base option to include the base text in
  conflicts.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* The config files are now read using ConfigObj, so '=' should be used as
  a separator, not ':'.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* New 'bzr commit --strict' option refuses to commit if there are
  any unknown files in the tree.  To commit, make sure all files are
  either ignored, added, or deleted.  (Michael Ellerman)

* The config directory is now ~/.bazaar, and there is a single file
  ~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf storing email, editor and other preferences.
  (Robert Collins)

* 'bzr add' no longer takes a --verbose option, and a --quiet option
  has been added that suppresses all output.

* Improved zsh completion support in contrib/zsh, from Clint
  Adams.

* Builtin 'bzr annotate' command, by Martin Pool with improvements from
  Goffredo Baroncelli.

* 'bzr check' now accepts -v for verbose reporting, and checks for
  ghosts in the branch. (Robert Collins)

* New command 're-sign' which will regenerate the gpg signature for
  a revision. (Robert Collins)

* If you set ``check_signatures=require`` for a path in
  ``~/.bazaar/branches.conf`` then bzr will invoke your
  ``gpg_signing_command`` (defaults to gpg) and record a digital signature
  of your commit. (Robert Collins)

* New sftp transport, based on Paramiko.  (Robey Pointer)

* 'bzr pull' now accepts '--clobber' which will discard local changes
  and make this branch identical to the source branch. (Robert Collins)

* Just give a quieter warning if a plugin can't be loaded, and
  put the details in .bzr.log.  (Martin Pool)

* 'bzr branch' will now set the branch-name to the last component of the
  output directory, if one was supplied.

* If the option ``post_commit`` is set to one (or more) python function
  names (must be in the bzrlib namespace), then they will be invoked
  after the commit has completed, with the branch and ``revision_id`` as
  parameters. (Robert Collins)

* Merge now has a retcode of 1 when conflicts occur. (Robert Collins)

* --merge-type weave is now supported for file contents.  Tree-shape
  changes are still three-way based.  (Martin Pool, Aaron Bentley)

* 'bzr check' allows the first revision on revision-history to have
  parents - something that is expected for cheap checkouts, and occurs
  when conversions from baz do not have all history.  (Robert Collins).

* 'bzr merge' can now graft unrelated trees together, if your specify
  0 as a base. (Aaron Bentley)

* 'bzr commit branch' and 'bzr commit branch/file1 branch/file2' now work
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Add '.sconsign*' to default ignore list.  (Alexander Belchenko)

* 'bzr merge --reprocess' minimizes conflicts

Testing
*******

* The 'bzr selftest --pattern' option for has been removed, now
  test specifiers on the command line can be simple strings, or
  regexps, or both. (Robert Collins)

* Passing -v to selftest will now show the time each test took to
  complete, which will aid in analysing performance regressions and
  related questions. (Robert Collins)

* 'bzr selftest' runs all tests, even if one fails, unless '--one'
  is given. (Martin Pool)

* There is a new method for TestCaseInTempDir, assertFileEqual, which
  will check that a given content is equal to the content of the named
  file. (Robert Collins)

* Fix test suite's habit of leaving many temporary log files in $TMPDIR.
  (Martin Pool)

Internals
*********

* New 'testament' command and concept for making gpg-signatures
  of revisions that are not tied to a particular internal
  representation.  (Martin Pool).

* Per-revision properties ('revprops') as key-value associated
  strings on each revision created when the revision is committed.
  Intended mainly for the use of external tools.  (Martin Pool).

* Config options have moved from bzrlib.osutils to bzrlib.config.
  (Robert Collins)

* Improved command line option definitions allowing explanations
  for individual options, among other things.  Contributed by
  Magnus Therning.

* Config options have moved from bzrlib.osutils to bzrlib.config.
  Configuration is now done via the config.Config interface:
  Depending on whether you have a Branch, a Location or no information
  available, construct a ``*Config``, and use its ``signature_checking``,
  ``username`` and ``user_email`` methods. (Robert Collins)

* Plugins are now loaded under bzrlib.plugins, not bzrlib.plugin, and
  they are made available for other plugins to use. You should not
  import other plugins during the ``__init__`` of your plugin though, as
  no ordering is guaranteed, and the plugins directory is not on the
  python path. (Robert Collins)

* Branch.relpath has been moved to WorkingTree.relpath. WorkingTree no
  no longer takes an inventory, rather it takes an option branch
  parameter, and if None is given will open the branch at basedir
  implicitly. (Robert Collins)

* Cleaner exception structure and error reporting.  Suggested by
  Scott James Remnant.  (Martin Pool)

* Branch.remove has been moved to WorkingTree, which has also gained
  ``lock_read``, ``lock_write`` and ``unlock`` methods for convenience.
  (Robert Collins)

* Two decorators, ``needs_read_lock`` and ``needs_write_lock`` have been
  added to the branch module. Use these to cause a function to run in a
  read or write lock respectively. (Robert Collins)

* ``Branch.open_containing`` now returns a tuple (Branch, relative-path),
  which allows direct access to the common case of 'get me this file
  from its branch'. (Robert Collins)

* Transports can register using ``register_lazy_transport``, and they
  will be loaded when first used.  (Martin Pool)

* 'pull' has been factored out of the command as ``WorkingTree.pull()``.
  A new option to WorkingTree.pull has been added, clobber, which will
  ignore diverged history and pull anyway.
  (Robert Collins)

* config.Config has a ``get_user_option`` call that accepts an option name.
  This will be looked up in branches.conf and bazaar.conf as normal.
  It is intended that this be used by plugins to support options -
  options of built in programs should have specific methods on the config.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``merge.merge_inner`` now has tempdir as an optional parameter.
  (Robert Collins)

* Tree.kind is not recorded at the top level of the hierarchy, as it was
  missing on EmptyTree, leading to a bug with merge on EmptyTrees.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``WorkingTree.__del__`` has been removed, it was non deterministic and not
  doing what it was intended to. See ``WorkingTree.__init__`` for a comment
  about future directions. (Robert Collins/Martin Pool)

* bzrlib.transport.http has been modified so that only 404 urllib errors
  are returned as NoSuchFile. Other exceptions will propagate as normal.
  This allows debuging of actual errors. (Robert Collins)

* bzrlib.transport.Transport now accepts *ONLY* url escaped relative paths
  to apis like 'put', 'get' and 'has'. This is to provide consistent
  behaviour - it operates on url's only. (Robert Collins)

* Transports can register using ``register_lazy_transport``, and they
  will be loaded when first used.  (Martin Pool)

* ``merge_flex`` no longer calls ``conflict_handler.finalize()``, instead that
  is called by ``merge_inner``. This is so that the conflict count can be
  retrieved (and potentially manipulated) before returning to the caller
  of ``merge_inner``. Likewise 'merge' now returns the conflict count to the
  caller. (Robert Collins)

* ``revision.revision_graph`` can handle having only partial history for
  a revision - that is no revisions in the graph with no parents.
  (Robert Collins).

* New ``builtins.branch_files`` uses the standard ``file_list`` rules to
  produce a branch and a list of paths, relative to that branch
  (Aaron Bentley)

* New TestCase.addCleanup facility.

* New ``bzrlib.version_info`` tuple (similar to ``sys.version_info``),
  which can be used by programs importing bzrlib.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Better handling of branches in directories with non-ascii names.
  (Joel Rosdahl, Panagiotis Papadakos)

* Upgrades of trees with no commits will not fail due to accessing
  [-1] in the revision-history. (Andres Salomon)


bzr 0.1.1
#########

:Released: 2005-10-12

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix problem in pulling over http from machines that do not
  allow directories to be listed.

* Avoid harmless warning about invalid hash cache after
  upgrading branch format.

Performance
***********

* Avoid some unnecessary http operations in branch and pull.


bzr 0.1
#######

:Released: 2005-10-11

Notes
*****

* 'bzr branch' over http initially gives a very high estimate
  of completion time but it should fall as the first few
  revisions are pulled in.  branch is still slow on
  high-latency connections.

Bug Fixes
*********

* bzr-man.py has been updated to work again. Contributed by
  Rob Weir.

* Locking is now done with fcntl.lockf which works with NFS
  file systems. Contributed by Harald Meland.

* When a merge encounters a file that has been deleted on
  one side and modified on the other, the old contents are
  written out to foo.BASE and foo.SIDE, where SIDE is this
  or OTHER. Contributed by Aaron Bentley.

* Export was choosing incorrect file paths for the content of
  the tarball, this has been fixed by Aaron Bentley.

* Commit will no longer commit without a log message, an
  error is returned instead. Contributed by Jelmer Vernooij.

* If you commit a specific file in a sub directory, any of its
  parent directories that are added but not listed will be
  automatically included. Suggested by Michael Ellerman.

* bzr commit and upgrade did not correctly record new revisions
  for files with only a change to their executable status.
  bzr will correct this when it encounters it. Fixed by
  Robert Collins

* HTTP tests now force off the use of ``http_proxy`` for the duration.
  Contributed by Gustavo Niemeyer.

* Fix problems in merging weave-based branches that have
  different partial views of history.

* Symlink support: working with symlinks when not in the root of a
  bzr tree was broken, patch from Scott James Remnant.

Improvements
************

* 'branch' now accepts a --basis parameter which will take advantage
  of local history when making a new branch. This allows faster
  branching of remote branches. Contributed by Aaron Bentley.

* New tree format based on weave files, called version 5.
  Existing branches can be upgraded to this format using
  'bzr upgrade'.

* Symlinks are now versionable. Initial patch by
  Erik Toubro Nielsen, updated to head by Robert Collins.

* Executable bits are tracked on files. Patch from Gustavo
  Niemeyer.

* 'bzr status' now shows unknown files inside a selected directory.
  Patch from Heikki Paajanen.

* Merge conflicts are recorded in .bzr. Two new commands 'conflicts'
  and 'resolve' have needed added, which list and remove those
  merge conflicts respectively. A conflicted tree cannot be committed
  in. Contributed by Aaron Bentley.

* 'rm' is now an alias for 'remove'.

* Stores now split out their content in a single byte prefixed hash,
  dropping the density of files per directory by 256. Contributed by
  Gustavo Niemeyer.

* 'bzr diff -r branch:URL' will now perform a diff between two branches.
  Contributed by Robert Collins.

* 'bzr log' with the default formatter will show merged revisions,
  indented to the right. Initial implementation contributed by Gustavo
  Niemeyer, made incremental by Robert Collins.


Internals
*********

* Test case failures have the exception printed after the log
  for your viewing pleasure.

* InventoryEntry is now an abstract base class, use one of the
  concrete InventoryDirectory etc classes instead.

* Branch raises an UnsupportedFormatError when it detects a
  bzr branch it cannot understand. This allows for precise
  handling of such circumstances.

* Remove RevisionReference class; ``Revision.parent_ids`` is now simply a
  list of their ids and ``parent_sha1s`` is a list of their corresponding
  sha1s (for old branches only at the moment.)

* New method-object style interface for Commit() and Fetch().

* Renamed ``Branch.last_patch()`` to ``Branch.last_revision()``, since
  we call them revisions not patches.

* Move ``copy_branch`` to ``bzrlib.clone.copy_branch``.  The destination
  directory is created if it doesn't exist.

* Inventories now identify the files which were present by
  giving the revision *of that file*.

* Inventory and Revision XML contains a version identifier.
  This must be consistent with the overall branch version
  but allows for more flexibility in future upgrades.

Testing
*******

* Removed testsweet module so that tests can be run after
  bzr installed by 'bzr selftest'.

* 'bzr selftest' command-line arguments can now be partial ids
  of tests to run, e.g. ``bzr selftest test_weave``


bzr 0.0.9
#########

:Released: 2005-09-23

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fixed "branch -r" option.

* Fix remote access to branches containing non-compressed history.
  (Robert Collins).

* Better reliability of http server tests.  (John Arbash-Meinel)

* Merge graph maximum distance calculation fix.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Various minor bug in windows support have been fixed, largely in the
  test suite. Contributed by Alexander Belchenko.

Improvements
************

* Status now accepts a -r argument to give status between chosen
  revisions. Contributed by Heikki Paajanen.

* Revision arguments no longer use +/-/= to control ranges, instead
  there is a 'before' namespace, which limits the successive namespace.
  For example '$ bzr log -r date:yesterday..before:date:today' will
  select everything from yesterday and before today. Contributed by
  Robey Pointer

* There is now a bzr.bat file created by distutils when building on
  Windows. Contributed by Alexander Belchenko.

Internals
*********

* Removed uuid() as it was unused.

* Improved 'fetch' code for pulling revisions from one branch into
  another (used by pull, merged, etc.)


bzr 0.0.8
#########

:Released: 2005-09-20


Improvements
************

* Adding a file whose parent directory is not versioned will
  implicitly add the parent, and so on up to the root. This means
  you should never need to explictly add a directory, they'll just
  get added when you add a file in the directory.  Contributed by
  Michael Ellerman.

* Ignore ``.DS_Store`` (contains Mac metadata) by default.
  (Nir Soffer)

* If you set ``BZR_EDITOR`` in the environment, it is checked in
  preference to EDITOR and the config file for the interactive commit
  editing program. Related to this is a bugfix where a missing program
  set in EDITOR would cause editing to fail, now the fallback program
  for the operating system is still tried.

* Files that are not directories/symlinks/regular files will no longer
  cause bzr to fail, it will just ignore them by default. You cannot add
  them to the tree though - they are not versionable.


Internals
*********

* Refactor xml packing/unpacking.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fixed 'bzr mv' by Ollie Rutherfurd.

* Fixed strange error when trying to access a nonexistent http
  branch.

* Make sure that the hashcache gets written out if it can't be
  read.


Portability
***********

* Various Windows fixes from Ollie Rutherfurd.

* Quieten warnings about locking; patch from Matt Lavin.


bzr-0.0.7
#########

:Released: 2005-09-02

New Features
************

* ``bzr shell-complete`` command contributed by Clint Adams to
  help with intelligent shell completion.

* New expert command ``bzr find-merge-base`` for debugging merges.


Enhancements
************

* Much better merge support.

* merge3 conflicts are now reported with markers like '<<<<<<<'
  (seven characters) which is the same as CVS and pleases things
  like emacs smerge.


Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr upgrade`` no longer fails when trying to fix trees that
  mention revisions that are not present.

* Fixed bugs in listing plugins from ``bzr plugins``.

* Fix case of $EDITOR containing options for the editor.

* Fix log -r refusing to show the last revision.
  (Patch from Goffredo Baroncelli.)


Changes
*******

* ``bzr log --show-ids`` shows the revision ids of all parents.

* Externally provided commands on your $BZRPATH no longer need
  to recognize --bzr-usage to work properly, and can just handle
  --help themselves.


Library
*******

* Changed trace messages to go through the standard logging
  framework, so that they can more easily be redirected by
  libraries.



bzr-0.0.6
#########

:Released: 2005-08-18

New Features
************

* Python plugins, automatically loaded from the directories on
  ``BZR_PLUGIN_PATH`` or ``~/.bzr.conf/plugins`` by default.

* New 'bzr mkdir' command.

* Commit mesage is fetched from an editor if not given on the
  command line; patch from Torsten Marek.

* ``bzr log -m FOO`` displays commits whose message matches regexp
  FOO.

* ``bzr add`` with no arguments adds everything under the current directory.

* ``bzr mv`` does move or rename depending on its arguments, like
  the Unix command.

* ``bzr missing`` command shows a summary of the differences
  between two trees.  (Merged from John Arbash-Meinel.)

* An email address for commits to a particular tree can be
  specified by putting it into .bzr/email within a branch.  (Based
  on a patch from Heikki Paajanen.)


Enhancements
************

* Faster working tree operations.


Changes
*******

* 3rd-party modules shipped with bzr are copied within the bzrlib
  python package, so that they can be installed by the setup
  script without clashing with anything already existing on the
  system.  (Contributed by Gustavo Niemeyer.)

* Moved plugins directory to bzrlib/, so that there's a standard
  plugin directory which is not only installed with bzr itself but
  is also available when using bzr from the development tree.
  ``BZR_PLUGIN_PATH`` and ``DEFAULT_PLUGIN_PATH`` are then added to the
  standard plugins directory.

* When exporting to a tarball with ``bzr export --format tgz``, put
  everything under a top directory rather than dumping it into the
  current directory.   This can be overridden with the ``--root``
  option.  Patch from William Dodé and John Meinel.

* New ``bzr upgrade`` command to upgrade the format of a branch,
  replacing ``bzr check --update``.

* Files within store directories are no longer marked readonly on
  disk.

* Changed ``bzr log`` output to a more compact form suggested by
  John A Meinel.  Old format is available with the ``--long`` or
  ``-l`` option, patched by William Dodé.

* By default the commit command refuses to record a revision with
  no changes unless the ``--unchanged`` option is given.

* The ``--no-plugins``, ``--profile`` and ``--builtin`` command
  line options must come before the command name because they
  affect what commands are available; all other options must come
  after the command name because their interpretation depends on
  it.

* ``branch`` and ``clone`` added as aliases for ``branch``.

* Default log format is back to the long format; the compact one
  is available with ``--short``.


Bug Fixes
*********

* Fix bugs in committing only selected files or within a subdirectory.


bzr-0.0.5
#########

:Released:  2005-06-15

Changes
*******

* ``bzr`` with no command now shows help rather than giving an
  error.  Suggested by Michael Ellerman.

* ``bzr status`` output format changed, because svn-style output
  doesn't really match the model of bzr.  Now files are grouped by
  status and can be shown with their IDs.  ``bzr status --all``
  shows all versioned files and unknown files but not ignored files.

* ``bzr log`` runs from most-recent to least-recent, the reverse
  of the previous order.  The previous behaviour can be obtained
  with the ``--forward`` option.

* ``bzr inventory`` by default shows only filenames, and also ids
  if ``--show-ids`` is given, in which case the id is the second
  field.


Enhancements
************

* New 'bzr whoami --email' option shows only the email component
  of the user identification, from Jo Vermeulen.

* New ``bzr ignore PATTERN`` command.

* Nicer error message for broken pipe, interrupt and similar
  conditions that don't indicate an internal error.

* Add ``.*.sw[nop] .git .*.tmp *,v`` to default ignore patterns.

* Per-branch locks keyed on ``.bzr/branch-lock``, available in
  either read or write mode.

* New option ``bzr log --show-ids`` shows revision and file ids.

* New usage ``bzr log FILENAME`` shows only revisions that
  affected that file.

* Changed format for describing changes in ``bzr log -v``.

* New option ``bzr commit --file`` to take a message from a file,
  suggested by LarstiQ.

* New syntax ``bzr status [FILE...]`` contributed by Bartosz
  Oler.  File may be in a branch other than the working directory.

* ``bzr log`` and ``bzr root`` can be given an http URL instead of
  a filename.

* Commands can now be defined by external programs or scripts
  in a directory on $BZRPATH.

* New "stat cache" avoids reading the contents of files if they
  haven't changed since the previous time.

* If the Python interpreter is too old, try to find a better one
  or give an error.  Based on a patch from Fredrik Lundh.

* New optional parameter ``bzr info [BRANCH]``.

* New form ``bzr commit SELECTED`` to commit only selected files.

* New form ``bzr log -r FROM:TO`` shows changes in selected
  range; contributed by John A Meinel.

* New option ``bzr diff --diff-options 'OPTS'`` allows passing
  options through to an external GNU diff.

* New option ``bzr add --no-recurse`` to add a directory but not
  their contents.

* ``bzr --version`` now shows more information if bzr is being run
  from a branch.


Bug Fixes
*********

* Fixed diff format so that added and removed files will be
  handled properly by patch.  Fix from Lalo Martins.

* Various fixes for files whose names contain spaces or other
  metacharacters.


Testing
*******

* Converted black-box test suites from Bourne shell into Python;
  now run using ``./testbzr``.  Various structural improvements to
  the tests.

* testbzr by default runs the version of bzr found in the same
  directory as the tests, or the one given as the first parameter.

* testbzr also runs the internal tests, so the only command
  required to check is just ``./testbzr``.

* testbzr requires python2.4, but can be used to test bzr running
  under a different version.

* Tests added for many other changes in this release.


Internal
********

* Included ElementTree library upgraded to 1.2.6 by Fredrik Lundh.

* Refactor command functions into Command objects based on HCT by
  Scott James Remnant.

* Better help messages for many commands.

* Expose ``bzrlib.open_tracefile()`` to start the tracefile; until
  this is called trace messages are just discarded.

* New internal function ``find_touching_revisions()`` and hidden
  command touching-revisions trace the changes to a given file.

* Simpler and faster ``compare_inventories()`` function.

* ``bzrlib.open_tracefile()`` takes a tracefilename parameter.

* New AtomicFile class.

* New developer commands ``added``, ``modified``.


Portability
***********

* Cope on Windows on python2.3 by using the weaker random seed.
  2.4 is now only recommended.


bzr-0.0.4
#########

:Released:  2005-04-22

Enhancements
************

* 'bzr diff' optionally takes a list of files to diff.  Still a bit
  basic.  Patch from QuantumG.

* More default ignore patterns.

* New 'bzr log --verbose' shows a list of files changed in the
  changeset.  Patch from Sebastian Cote.

* Roll over ~/.bzr.log if it gets too large.

* Command abbreviations 'ci', 'st', 'stat', '?' based on a patch
  by Jason Diamon.

* New 'bzr help commands' based on a patch from Denys Duchier.


Changes
*******

* User email is determined by looking at $BZREMAIL or ~/.bzr.email
  or $EMAIL.  All are decoded by the locale preferred encoding.
  If none of these are present user@hostname is used.  The host's
  fully-qualified name is not used because that tends to fail when
  there are DNS problems.

* New 'bzr whoami' command instead of username user-email.


Bug Fixes
*********

* Make commit safe for hardlinked bzr trees.

* Some Unicode/locale fixes.

* Partial workaround for ``difflib.unified_diff`` not handling
  trailing newlines properly.


Internal
********

* Allow docstrings for help to be in PEP0257 format.  Patch from
  Matt Brubeck.

* More tests in test.sh.

* Write profile data to a temporary file not into working
  directory and delete it when done.

* Smaller .bzr.log with process ids.


Portability
***********

* Fix opening of ~/.bzr.log on Windows.  Patch from Andrew
  Bennetts.

* Some improvements in handling paths on Windows, based on a patch
  from QuantumG.


bzr-0.0.3
#########

:Released:  2005-04-06

Enhancements
************

* New "directories" internal command lists versioned directories
  in the tree.

* New "rename" command to rename one file to a different name
  and/or directory.

* New "move" command to move one or more files into a different
  directory.

* New "renames" command lists files renamed since base revision.

* New cat command contributed by janmar.

Changes
*******

* .bzr.log is placed in $HOME (not pwd) and is always written in
  UTF-8.  (Probably not a completely good long-term solution, but
  will do for now.)

Portability
***********

* Workaround for difflib bug in Python 2.3 that causes an
  exception when comparing empty files.  Reported by Erik Toubro
  Nielsen.

Internal
********

* Refactored inventory storage to insert a root entry at the top.

Testing
*******

* Start of shell-based black-box testing in test.sh.
