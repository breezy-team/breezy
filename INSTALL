Installation
============

Requirements
------------

Bazaar
~~~~~~

You will need a recent version of Bazaar, usually the release of Bazaar 
released in the same month as the release of bzr-svn you are using. bzr-svn 
will warn if the Bazaar release used is too old or too new.

SQLite
~~~~~~

If you are using Python 2.4, you will need to have the pysqlite module 
installed.  Python 2.5 and higher have sqlite support built in. 

Subversion development files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need the Subversion libraries, including the development files. This should
be readily packaged for most platforms. The package name for Debian 
and Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu is ``libsvn-dev``. 

From Source on Mac OS X
***********************

To install on OS X Leopard do something like the following.  Note: If you have MacPython installed, you may encounter problems when building BzrSvn.  

::

  # Install the latest stable Bazaar (if you didn't already)
  sudo easy_install -U paramiko pycrypto bzr

  # Install the bzr_svn plugin
  mkdir ~/.bazaar ~/.bazaar/plugins
  cd ~/.bazaar/plugins
  rm -rf svn
  bzr checkout --lightweight \
    http://people.samba.org/bzr/jelmer/bzr-svn/stable svn

  make

 
bzr-rebase
~~~~~~~~~~

In order to be able to use the ``svn-upgrade`` command (for those 
who used versions of bzr-svn older than 0.4.0), you will need the `bzr-rebase`_ 
plugin.

.. _bzr-rebase: http://bazaar-vcs.org/Rebase

Building
--------

Simply place this directory in ~/.bazaar/plugins and you should be able 
to check out branches from Subversion using bzr. Make sure the directory 
name is 'svn'. The plugin has to be built as well by running ``make``.

Packages
--------

Instead of installing the plugin yourself, you can also install a prepackaged 
version of it for your platform.

Windows Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An unofficial bzr-svn installer for Win32 as well as an unofficial, patched build of Python-Subversion for Windows can be found at http://d5190871.u44.websitesource.net/bzr/.  This package can be used with the Python-based installer or the standalone installation of Bazaar.

Debian/Ubuntu GNU/Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Debian/Ubuntu packages are available from `Jelmer's Debian repository`_. 

.. _Jelmer's Debian repository: http://samba.org/~jelmer/debian/

Ubuntu's in-development release and Debian sid usually also contain the latest release.

GoboLinux
^^^^^^^^^
GoboLinux includes `a recipe <http://recipes.gobolinux.org/r/?list=BZR-SVN>`_ for bzr-svn.

OpenSuse Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
OpenSuse packages created by Michael Wolf are available from http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/maw:/bzr/

Gentoo Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^
An unofficial Gentoo overlay containing the patches for Subversion versions 1.3 and 1.4, plus a bzr-svn ebuild are hosted on launchpad at https://launchpad.net/bzr-gentoo-overlay/.

Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^

Download the latest Subversion DMG from: http://svnbinaries.open.collab.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList

After installing, add the svn-python bindings to your Python2.5 installation

::

  # Tiger
  echo "/opt/subversion-1.5.x/lib/svn-python/" > /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/subversion.pth

  # Leopard
  echo "/opt/subversion-1.5.x/lib/svn-python/" > /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/subversion.pth

Install the bzr_svn plugin following the instructions in the `From Source`_ section (a DMG is coming soon ;) )

..
	vim: ft=rest
