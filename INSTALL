Breezy install instructions
***************************

Dependencies
------------

Breezy requires Python 3.6 or newer as well as the rust compiler.

It also requires the `setuptools`, `setuptools_rust`, `configobj`,
`fastbencode` and `patiencediff` Python modules to be installed.

These can be installed either from your operating system's package
manager, using pip or by downloading them from:

  configobj: https://github.com/DiffSK/configobj
  patiencediff: https://github.com/breezy-team/patiencediff
  fastbencode: https://github.com/breezy-team/fastbencode

Optional dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to access branches over sftp, you will need paramiko and
pycrypto:

To PGP sign commits and verify PGP signatures on commits, install
python-gpgme.

For Git support, install Dulwich:

For fastimport support, install python-fastimport:

brz can optionally use compiled versions of some parts of the code
for increased speed. When installing brz you need the ability to
build C extensions. Some GNU/Linux distributions package the necessary
headers separately from the main Python package. This package is
probably named something like python-dev or python-devel. FreeBSD,
Windows, source-based GNU/Linux distributions, and possibly other operating
systems, have the required files installed by default.

If you are installing brz from a brz branch rather than a release tarball,
then you should also have the Cython package installed. This is not necessary
for release tarballs as they already contain the C files that Cython is needed
to create.

Installation
------------

When upgrading using setup.py, it is recommended that you first delete the
bzrlib directory from the install target.

To install brz as a user, run

  python setup.py install --home ~

To install system-wide, run (as root)

  python setup.py install
