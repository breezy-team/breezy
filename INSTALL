Installation
------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bazaar
^^^^^^

You will need a recent version of Bazaar, usually the release of Bazaar 
released in the same month as the release of bzr-svn you are using. bzr-svn 
will warn if the Bazaar release used is too old or too new.

SQLite
^^^^^^

If you are using Python 2.4, you will need to have the pysqlite module 
installed.  Python 2.5 and higher have sqlite support built in. 

Subversion development files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need the Subversion libraries, including the development files. This should
be readily packaged for most platforms. The package name for Debian 
and Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu is ``libsvn-dev``. 

bzr-rebase
^^^^^^^^^^

In order to be able to use the ``svn-upgrade`` command (for those 
who used versions of bzr-svn older than 0.4.0), you will need the `bzr-rebase`_ 
plugin.

.. _bzr-rebase: http://bazaar-vcs.org/Rebase

Building
~~~~~~~~

Simply place this directory in ~/.bazaar/plugins and you should be able 
to check out branches from Subversion using bzr. Make sure the directory 
name is 'svn'. The plugin has to be built as well by running ``make``.

Packages
~~~~~~~~

Instead of installing the plugin yourself, you can also install a prepackaged 
version of it for your platform.

Windows Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An unofficial bzr-svn installer for Win32 as well as an unofficial, patched build of Python-Subversion for Windows can be found at http://d5190871.u44.websitesource.net/bzr/.  This package can be used with the Python-based installer or the standalone installation of Bazaar.

Debian/Ubuntu GNU/Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Debian/Ubuntu packages are available from `Jelmer's Debian repository`_. 

.. _Jelmer's Debian repository: http://samba.org/~jelmer/debian/

Ubuntu's in-development release and Debian sid usually also contain the latest release.

GoboLinux
^^^^^^^^^
GoboLinux includes `a recipe <http://recipes.gobolinux.org/r/?list=BZR-SVN>`_ for bzr-svn.

OpenSuse Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
OpenSuse packages created by Michael Wolf are available from http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/maw:/bzr/

Gentoo Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^
An unofficial Gentoo overlay containing the patches for Subversion versions 1.3 and 1.4, plus a bzr-svn ebuild are hosted on launchpad at https://launchpad.net/bzr-gentoo-overlay/.

Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^

Download the latest Subversion DMG from: http://svnbinaries.open.collab.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList

bzr-svn DMG packages can be found in bzr-svn launchpad page.

bzr-svn is now also available in MacPorts, and can be installed with: $ sudo port install bzr-svn
