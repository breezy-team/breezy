Breezy install instructions
***************************

Dependencies
------------

Breezy requires Python 3.9 or newer as well as the rust compiler.

It also requires the `setuptools`, `setuptools_rust`, ``setuptools_gettext``,
`configobj`, `fastbencode` and `patiencediff` Python modules to be installed.

Optional dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

python-gpgme.

brz can optionally use compiled versions of some parts of the code
for increased speed. When installing brz you need the ability to
build C extensions. Some GNU/Linux distributions package the necessary
headers separately from the main Python package. This package is
probably named something like python-dev or python-devel. FreeBSD,
Windows, source-based GNU/Linux distributions, and possibly other operating
systems, have the required files installed by default.

If you are installing brz from a brz branch rather than a release tarball,
then you should also have the Cython package installed. This is not necessary
for release tarballs as they already contain the C files that Cython is needed
to create.
