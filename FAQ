bzr-svn frequently asked questions
==================================

.. contents::

Bazaar is using a lot of memory accessing a Subversion repository
-----------------------------------------------------------------
bzr-svn can use a lot of memory cloning big branches when older 
versions of the python-subversion bindings are used. This memory leak 
has been fixed in the trunk of Subversion (r28544) and has been 
proposed for inclusion in Subversion 1.4.7.

One way to work around this problem is to Ctrl+C the branch operation 
and restart it.

I am unable to access a repository that requires user/password authentication or uses self-signed SSL certificates
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Python bindings required for password prompting are only present in 
version 1.5 of Subversion so password prompting is only possible if 
you have that version installed.

If you have an older version of Subversion installed, bzr-svn can 
use passwords cached by Subversion or credentials specified in the URL. 

Subversion can be forced to cache the password by accessing the repository 
using the Subversion command-line client. 
For example, try running 'svn info <url>'. 

You can specify the username and password in the URL in the standard way, e.g.::

  $ bzr co svn+http://guest:@tortoisesvn.tigris.org/svn/tortoisesvn/trunk

If you are using a Subversion repository over http or https it may be 
necessary to prefix the repository URL with "svn+", e.g. 
svn+http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/

Trying to branch into repository gives an error about incompatibility.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Creating a repository and then trying to clone a Subversion branch into 
that repository may cause the following error:

::

  bzr: ERROR: Repository KnitRepository is not compatible with repository SvnRepository

bzr-svn requires a repository format that supports recording root file ids. To 
upgrade the repository, run: 

::

 $ bzr upgrade --rich-root-pack

Pushing a branch that didn't exist in Subversion yet with `bzr push` fails.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the moment, only `bzr svn-push` can be used to push new branches into 
Subversion. Future releases will include this functionality in `bzr push`.

More information can be found in the bug report at:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr-svn/+bug/127945.

Cloning a large Subversion branch is very slow
----------------------------------------------
There is no way around this at the moment, because Bazaar has to import all 
the history from the Subversion branch as it doesn't support so-called 
history horizons yet. 

More information about history horizons can be found at:
http://bazaar-vcs.org/HistoryHorizon

The Bazaar revno's differ from the Subversion revno's
-----------------------------------------------------
That's right. Bazaar revision numbers are per-branch, whereas Subversion revno's are per-repository. If you 
would like to use Subversion revision numbers, use the "svn:" revision specifier. For example:

::

  $ bzr ls -rsvn:34 svn://example.com/bar

After upgrading bzr-svn, Bazaar reports branches have diverged while pulling, when they haven't
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of version 0.4, bzr-svn creates revisions with different revision ids than 
previous versions. In other words, existing bzr-svn branches created with 
0.3.x can not be used directly with 0.4.0 but will have to be upgraded to 
work with 0.4.0 using the "bzr svn-upgrade" command. The bzr-rebase package 
has to be installed for this command to work correctly.

Is it possible to keep the author name when pushing changes into Subversion?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, but this requires the repository to allow revision property changes. 

See hooks/pre-revprop-change in the Subversion repository for 
more information about how to do this.

You also need to enable support for this in bzr-svn by setting 
``override-svn-revprops`` to True in ~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf.

I converted my Subversion repository using svn-import, but now all branches are empty!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

bzr-svn does not create working trees by default. If you need 
the working trees, run "bzr checkout" in the branch or 
specify --trees to svn-import.

bzr-svn did a replace operation on the branch I pushed to when I tried to push a merge commit to Subversion
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, this is because bzr-svn has to preserve the mainline history of your 
branch. 

If you would like to avoid this, use a checkout and merge into that ("bzr co") 
or rebase on trunk rather than merge it. 

For example::

 $ bzr push ../trunk
 bzr: ERROR: These branches have diverged.  Try using "merge" and then "push".
 $ bzr rebase ../trunk
 All changes applied successfully.
 ...
 $ bzr push ../trunk
 All changes applied successfully.
 Pushed up to revision 1075.

If you would like to forbid Bazaar from ever doing these operations, set the 
``append-revisions-only`` setting to True for the repository you're 
pushing to.
